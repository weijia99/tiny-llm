# Week 1 Day 1: Attention and Multi-Head Attention

The starter provides `softmax` through MLX so that Day 1 can focus on the attention data flow. Your required work is to
complete `scaled_dot_product_attention_simple` and `SimpleMultiHeadAttention` in `src/tiny_llm/attention.py`, plus the
`linear` helper in `src/tiny_llm/basics.py`. Other attention functions in the starter are for later days and are not part
of this chapter.

Start by running the focused Task 1 tests. The command refreshes the supplied Day 1 test in `tests/` before running it:

```console
pdm run test --week 1 --day 1 -- -k task_1
```

The supplied `softmax` cases pass in the untouched starter, while the attention cases fail. This expected red checkpoint
shows the behavior that your attention implementation must add.

An attention layer processes an input sequence and weighs the relevance of its different positions when producing each
output. Attention is a key building block of Transformer models.

[📚 Reading: Transformer Architecture](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/chapter1/6)

We use Qwen3, a decoder-only model, for text generation. The model takes a sequence of token IDs, maps them to embeddings,
and produces logits for the next token at each sequence position. The generation loop will later use the final position's
logits to choose the next token ID.

[📚 Reading: LLM Inference, the Decode Phase](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/chapter1/8)

An attention layer takes a query, a key, and a value. In a basic implementation, all three have the same shape:
`N.. x L x D`.

`N..` represents zero or more batch dimensions. Within each batch, `L` is the sequence length and `D` is the embedding
dimension for one attention head.

For example, a sequence of 1,024 tokens with a head dimension of 512 is represented by a tensor of shape
`N.. x 1024 x 512`.

## Task 1: Implement `scaled_dot_product_attention_simple`

In this task, we will implement scaled dot-product attention. We assume that the input tensors Q, K, and V have the same
shape. Later chapters will introduce attention variants whose input shapes differ.

```
src/tiny_llm/attention.py
```

Implement `scaled_dot_product_attention_simple` using the formula below. The function takes query, key, and value tensors
with the same shape, plus an optional additive mask `M`.

$$
  \text{Attention} = \text{softmax}(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} + M)V
$$

Here, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d_k}}$ is the default scale factor. Callers may supply a different scale factor.

```
L is seq_len, in PyTorch API it's S (source len)
D is head_dim

key: N.. x L x D
value: N.. x L x D
query: N.. x L x D
output: N.. x L x D
scale = 1/sqrt(D) if not specified
```

Use the supplied `softmax` helper for the required exercise. As an optional, ungraded bonus, replace its MLX call with
your own numerically stable implementation: subtract the maximum value along `axis`, exponentiate the shifted values,
then divide by their sum along the same axis. Preserve the helper's public API and output behavior.

When this function is called from multi-head attention, the tensors will usually have these shapes:

```
key: 1 x H x L x D
value: 1 x H x L x D
query: 1 x H x L x D
output: 1 x H x L x D
mask: 1 x H x L x L
```

The function itself operates on the last two dimensions and must support any number of leading batch dimensions. The mask
only needs a shape that can broadcast to the attention-score shape.

Run the Task 1 checkpoint again after implementing the function:

```
pdm run test --week 1 --day 1 -- -k task_1
```

When this checkpoint turns green, your attention function supports arbitrary leading batch dimensions, optional masks,
and default or explicit scaling.

## Task 2: Implement `SimpleMultiHeadAttention`

In this task, we will implement the multi-head attention layer.

```
src/tiny_llm/attention.py
```

Implement `SimpleMultiHeadAttention`. The layer projects batches of query, key, and value vectors with the Q, K, and V
weight matrices, then passes the projections to the attention function from Task 1. Finally, it applies the output projection
O.

First, implement the `linear` function in `basics.py`. It takes a tensor of shape `N.. x I`, a weight matrix of shape
`O x I`, and an optional bias vector of shape `O`. Its output has shape `N.. x O`, where `I` is the input dimension and
`O` is the output dimension.

Use the focused linear tests as your next checkpoint:

```console
pdm run test --week 1 --day 1 -- -k test_task_2_linear
```

Before you implement `linear`, this checkpoint is red. When it turns green, `linear` supports optional bias across the
tested precisions and devices.

For `SimpleMultiHeadAttention`, the input tensors `query`, `key`, and `value` have shape `N x L x E`, where `E` is the
embedding dimension for one token. The Q, K, and V projections each map `E` to `H x D`: `H` heads, each with dimension
`D`. Reshape that final projection dimension into separate `H` and `D` dimensions.

You now have a tensor of shape `N x L x H x D` for each projection. Before applying attention, transpose each one to
`N x H x L x D`.

- This treats each attention head as an independent batch, allowing attention to be calculated separately for each head
  across sequence dimension `L`.
- Leaving `H` after `L` would cause the matrix multiplication to mix the head and sequence dimensions. Each head must attend
  only to token relationships within its own subspace.

The attention function produces one output per head. Transpose the result back to `N x L x H x D`, reshape it to
`N x L x (H x D)`, and apply the output projection.

```
E is hidden_size or embed_dim or dims or model_dim
H is num_heads
D is head_dim
L is seq_len, in PyTorch API it's S (source len)

w_q/w_k/w_v: (H x D) x E
output/input: N x L x E
w_o: E x (H x D)
```

Run the Task 2 checkpoint after implementing the layer:

```console
pdm run test --week 1 --day 1 -- -k task_2
```

When this checkpoint turns green, your layer projects query, key, and value tensors into independent attention heads and
recombines their outputs through the final projection.

You can run all tests for the day with:

```console
pdm run test --week 1 --day 1
```

When the full Day 1 suite turns green, you have a standalone multi-head attention layer that projects Q/K/V, evaluates
each head independently, and recombines the result. Day 3 will generalize this attention mechanism to grouped-query
attention for Qwen3; the `SimpleMultiHeadAttention` layer built here is a standalone exercise, not the model's exact call
path.
