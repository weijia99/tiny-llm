# 🚧 Week 2 Day 1: KV Cache

You arrive with the Week 1 Qwen model and full-prefix generation loop still
working. Day 1 leaves them unchanged and completes the separate Week 2 shells:

- `src/tiny_llm/kv_cache.py::TinyKvFullCache` stores one layer's dense K/V;
- `src/tiny_llm/qwen3_week2.py::Qwen3ModelWeek2` threads cache state and
  offsets through the model;
- `Qwen3ModelWeek2.create_kv_cache` creates one cache per layer and request;
- `src/tiny_llm/generate.py` prefills once, then sends only the new token.

Those four pieces are your work. The starter already supplies the Week 1
operators and the model-loading boundary. Your first useful feedback is the
focused learner gate:

```bash
pdm run test --week 2 --day 1
```

When it passes, run the `kv-cache` checkpoint shown in Task 4. That live call
is where the cache becomes part of generation rather than an isolated data
structure.

The cache lets each attention layer reuse the keys and values from previous
tokens instead of recomputing the entire prefix at every step.

This is the foundation of Week 2 decode optimization, not a serving-only Week 3
feature. Without it, every generated token reruns all model layers over an
ever-growing prefix, overwhelming the gains from faster individual kernels.

Recall how Week 1 repeatedly supplied the full sequence to the model:

```plain
tokenized_prompt: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
prefill: _step(model, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) # returns 7
decode:  _step(model, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) # returns 8
decode:  _step(model, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]) # returns 9
...
```

```plain
x: B, L, E
q = linear(x, wq) -> B, L, H_q, D
k = linear(x, wk) -> B, L, H, D
v = linear(x, wv) -> B, L, H, D
q = rms_norm(q, q_norm)
k = rms_norm(k, k_norm)
q = rope(q, offset=slice(offset, offset + L))
k = rope(k, offset=slice(offset, offset + L))
(transpose as needed)
x = scaled_dot_product_attention_grouped(q, k, v, scale, mask) -> B, L, H_q, D
# q/k/v and the returned model tensor are BF16; the Python `mlx.core` expression may use FP32 intermediates
(transpose as needed)
x = linear(x, wo) -> B, L, E
```

The attention mechanism is computed as:

$$
  \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} + M\right)V
$$


Consider two consecutive decoding steps with `L = S = 3` and `L = S = 4`.
Assume that each attention head has dimension `D = 4`:

```
L = 3
Q        x  K^T     =         
1 1 1 1     1 2 3      1x1  -inf -inf
2 2 2 2     1 2 3      2x1  2x2  -inf
3 3 3 3     1 2 3      3x1  3x2  3x3
            1 2 3

L = 4
Q        x  K^T       =
1 1 1 1     1 2 3 4      1x1  -inf -inf -inf
2 2 2 2     1 2 3 4      2x1  2x2  -inf -inf
3 3 3 3     1 2 3 4      3x1  3x2  3x3  -inf
4 4 4 4     1 2 3 4      4x1  4x2  4x3  4x4
```

The leading `3 x 3` block of `QK^T` is identical in both steps. A causal mask
also prevents earlier queries from attending to the new token, so their outputs
do not change. Recomputing those rows, their softmax values, and their products
with `V` is wasted work. Only the new query row contributes a new output.

Instead, cache the previous keys and values and compute only the projections for
incoming tokens:

```
K in cache:
1 1 1 1
2 2 2 2

[a b c d] represent cached values

L = 1, S = 3
Q        x  K^T       =         
            (⬇️ is K not transposed)
            [1 1 1 1]      
            [2 2 2 2]      
3 3 3 3      3 3 3 3      3x1 3x2 3x3

L = 1, S = 4
Q        x  K^T       = 
            (⬇️ is K not transposed)
            [1 1 1 1]      
            [2 2 2 2]      
            [3 3 3 3]
4 4 4 4      4 4 4 4      4x1 4x2 4x3 4x4
```

## Task 1: Implement the Key-Value Cache

```
src/tiny_llm/kv_cache.py
```

Each Transformer layer maintains its own key-value cache. The cache exposes one
method, `update_and_fetch`, which:

1. Accepts the newly computed `K` and `V` for the incoming tokens.
2. Appends them along the sequence dimension.
3. Returns the complete cached `K` and `V`, the updated offset, and the mask.

In this chapter, the cache passes `mask` through unchanged and does not use
`mask_length`. Those parameters become important in Week 3 for batching.

You may implement this in `kv_cache.py` as `TinyKvFullCache`:

```plain
L_new = number of incoming tokens

update_and_fetch(key, value, mask_length, mask) -> key, value, offset, mask

key:   B, H, L_new, D
value: B, H, L_new, D

if self.key_values is None:
    self.key_values = (key, value)
else:
    cached_key, cached_value = self.key_values
    self.key_values = (
        concat(cached_key, key, axis=2),
        concat(cached_value, value, axis=2),
    )

self.offset += L_new
key, value = self.key_values  # B, H, offset, D

return key, value, self.offset, mask
```

This is deliberately a simple dense baseline, not a production KV cache.
`mx.concat` allocates a larger buffer and copies the previous K/V contents on
every growth step. Over a token-by-token decode of length `S`, those copies add
up to `O(S²)` bytes even though caching avoids `O(S²)` prefix recomputation.
The reference cache records this traffic as `growth_copy_bytes` so the profiler
can keep it separate from attention. Week 3 replaces this baseline with
preallocated pages; do not copy the repeated-concatenation design into a
serving cache.

## Task 2: Build the Cached Week 2 Model

```
src/tiny_llm/qwen3_week2.py
```

Keep the Week 1 Python model and its full-prefix generation loop unchanged.
Start a separate `qwen3_week2.py` model with the same dense weights and the
Week 1 `mlx.core` RMSNorm, RoPE, SwiGLU, and attention equations. Change only the state flow in
this chapter: the Week 2 model accepts a cache and an offset while Week 1 keeps
recomputing the full prefix. This produces the baseline that every later Week 2
chapter will optimize.

- Give each layer its own cache.
- Add an `offset` argument to the model. It is the number of tokens already in
  the cache, and therefore the position of the first incoming token.
- The argument should match the cache's current sequence length. Assertions can
  make this invariant explicit.
- The caller and cache both track the offset to make consistency checks easier.

Example computation flow:

```plain
x: B, L, E
q = linear(x, wq) -> B, L, H_q, D
k = linear(x, wk) -> B, L, H, D
v = linear(x, wv) -> B, L, H, D
q = rms_norm(q, q_norm)
k = rms_norm(k, k_norm)
q = rope(q, offset=slice(offset, offset + L))
k = rope(k, offset=slice(offset, offset + L))
transpose q, k, v to B, H, L, D
k, v = cache.update_and_fetch(k, v)  # k/v: B, H, S, D; q: B, H_q, L, D
x = scaled_dot_product_attention_grouped(q, k, v, scale, mask) -> B, H_q, L, D
# q/k/v and the returned model tensor are BF16; attention arithmetic is still the Week 1 `mlx.core` path
transpose and reshape x to B, L, H_q * D
x = linear(x, wo) -> B, L, E
```

Here, `L` is the number of incoming query tokens and `S` is the total cached
sequence length after the update. This matches the Week 1 GQA convention: `L`
is the query length, while `S` is the key/value source length. During
single-token decoding, `L = 1` and `S` grows by one on each call.

The linear layers, RMSNorm, RoPE, SwiGLU, and attention remain the Week 1
Python implementations at this checkpoint. Do not introduce packed weights or fast
kernels yet: measuring one algorithmic change makes the gain attributable.
The model still uses BF16 storage; "Week 1 Python" describes the
implementation style, not a return to an FP32 model.

## Task 3: Create Request-Scoped Caches

```
src/tiny_llm/qwen3_week2.py
```

Implement `create_kv_cache` so every request gets one cache handle per
Transformer layer. Pass the matching layer cache through every block and keep
the caller's offset consistent with the cache's logical length.

The Day 1 test checks this request-scoped lifecycle together with the cache and
model work from the earlier tasks.

## Task 4: Connect the Serving Loop

```
src/tiny_llm/generate.py
```

The first model call prefills the cache with the complete prompt. Each later
call passes only the token produced by the preceding step, together with the
number of tokens already cached. The same lifecycle will be owned by the
continuous-batching scheduler in Week 3.

For example:

```plain
tokenized_prompt: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
prefill: _step(model, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 0)  # returns 7
decode:  _step(model, [7], 6)  # returns 8
decode:  _step(model, [8], 7)  # returns 9
...
```

You can test your solution with:

```bash
pdm run main --solution tiny_llm --loader week2 \
  --week2-checkpoint kv-cache --model qwen3-4b
```

You can also run the same loop with the reference solution:

```bash
pdm run main --solution tiny_llm_ref --loader week2 \
  --week2-checkpoint kv-cache --model qwen3-4b
```

## Integrate and Measure

Run the cached Week 1 checkpoint end to end before changing any operator:

```bash
pdm run bench --solution tiny_llm --loader week2 \
  --week2-checkpoint kv-cache --model qwen3-4b \
  --num-seqs 1 --min-input-len 128 --max-input-len 128 \
  --min-output-len 65 --max-output-len 65 --warmup 2
```

Keep one result as the input to Day 2's matched comparison. Every later command
changes one cumulative checkpoint.

Day 1 is an algorithmic checkpoint, so it does not invent a shader-level
limiter from a GPU trace. The checkpoint removes full-prefix recomputation;
use the end-to-end benchmark to measure that algorithmic change. Day 2 measures
this model and identifies the projection-weight bandwidth bottleneck. Day 3
introduces 4-bit quantization and implements the SIMD matvec kernel that
operates on packed weights directly.
