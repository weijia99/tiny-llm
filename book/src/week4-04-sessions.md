# Day 4: Checkpoint and Resume

Days 1 through 3 build one uninterrupted coding-agent run. The model proposes
an action, the harness executes it, and the result becomes the next model
observation. But if the process stops, a new model object does not know which
conversation prefix it had already processed.

Day 4 makes one boundary visible: save the conversation and the small model
snapshot immediately after a complete tool observation, then restore both into
a fresh scripted model and continue at the next response. The completed tools
stay completed; resume starts after their observations instead of replaying
them.

This is a teaching checkpoint for one process and the course's fake model. It
is not a session tree, rewind feature, persistent KV store, transaction log, or
exactly-once effect system.

## Files and Public Surface

The final scaffold already declares compaction, steering, evaluation,
branching, and evidence APIs. Leave those future TODO bodies alone. Day 4 owns
only the checkpoint model and the two loop entry points below:

Implement the TODO-only surfaces in:

| File | Public names | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/tiny_llm/agent/checkpoint.py` | `ModelCheckpoint`, `AgentCheckpoint`, `create_checkpoint` | Represent and validate one in-memory conversation/model snapshot. |
| `src/tiny_llm/agent/loop.py` | `run_to_checkpoint`, `resume_agent` | Stop after a complete observation, then continue with a fresh model. |
| `src/tiny_llm/agent/__init__.py` | the names above | Complete the Day 4 exports within the final scaffold. |

Run the cumulative learner checkpoint from the repository root:

```bash
pdm run test --week 4 --day 4
```

Before you implement the TODOs, all seven Day 4 tasks are expected to fail.
The test uses a scripted model, fake cache metadata, a temporary workspace, and
one exact Python validation command. It does not load model weights. The
command force-refreshes and runs the supplied learner tests for Days 1--4
together.

Course maintainers can check the supplied implementation without copying the
learner test:

```bash
pdm run test-refsol --week 4 --day 4
```

## One Safe Loop Boundary

A checkpoint is saved only after the harness has appended both halves of a
tool interaction:

```text
assistant: {"tool":"edit_file", ...}
user:      Tool result:\nedited app.py
                                      ^ checkpoint here
```

Saving before the observation would leave the restored model unable to tell
whether the tool ran. Day 4 therefore counts completed tool calls and saves at
the boundary after `_append_tool_result(...)` has produced the next complete
conversation.

The checkpoint stores the semantic messages, not the `AgentEvent` history.
Day 3 receipts remain separate evidence about the edit or command. They are not
copied into the checkpoint and they do not become a replay controller.

## Task 1: Represent the Fake Model Snapshot

`ModelCheckpoint` contains four fields, in order:

```python
conversation_position: int
response_index: int
cached_token_ids: tuple[int, ...]
layer_offsets: tuple[int, ...]
```

`conversation_position` is the number of semantic messages at the saved
boundary. `response_index` tells the scripted model which response comes next.
`cached_token_ids` represents the prompt prefix in the fake cache, and every
`layer_offsets` entry must equal its length.

Reject negative positions, invalid token IDs, a missing layer snapshot, or
offsets that disagree with the cached prefix. These checks make the fake model
state internally coherent without introducing a production cache format.

## Task 2: Bind Conversation and Model State

`AgentCheckpoint` contains:

```python
checkpoint_id: str
task: str
messages: tuple[tuple[str, str], ...]
model: ModelCheckpoint
```

`create_checkpoint(task, messages, model)` copies each mutable message into an
immutable `(role, content)` pair. It computes `checkpoint_id` as the SHA-256 of
canonical JSON containing the task, messages, and model fields.

`AgentCheckpoint.validate()` checks the ordinary resume contract:

- the task and messages are structurally valid;
- the model's conversation position equals the saved message count;
- the checkpoint ID still matches the content.

This identity check catches an accidental mismatch. It is not a hostile-tamper
or authentication scheme.

## Task 3: Stop After a Complete Observation

`run_to_checkpoint(task, generate, workspace, after_tool_calls=1, limits=None)`
starts with the same prompt and validation rules as `run_agent`. It counts a
tool call only after execution and observation append. At the requested count,
it calls:

```python
model_state = generate.save_checkpoint(messages)
```

and returns an `AgentCheckpoint`.

The generator must return a `ModelCheckpoint`. A missing checkpoint method, a
non-positive tool-call count, or a run that finishes before the boundary is a
clear error instead of a partial checkpoint.

## Task 4: Restore a Fresh Model

`resume_agent(checkpoint, fresh_generate, workspace, limits=None)` validates the
checkpoint, calls:

```python
fresh_generate.restore_checkpoint(checkpoint.model)
```

rebuilds the semantic message list, and enters the normal loop. The fresh model
therefore sees the exact conversation prefix and produces the response at the
saved `response_index`.

No old tool action is submitted again. The first model call after restore sees
the already-recorded tool result and chooses the next action or final answer.

## Task 5: Make the Fake Cache Visible

The test's `FakeCheckpointModel` turns each message content length into one fake
token ID. `save_checkpoint(messages)` records those token IDs, two matching
layer offsets, and the next scripted-response index. A new model object restores
that state and asserts that its first resumed input has the same token prefix
and conversation position.

This deliberately small representation exposes the inference/harness
integration: the harness owns semantic conversation state, while the model owns
the cache snapshot that accelerates exactly that state.

## Task 6: Resume Without Replaying Effects

The end-to-end test scripts:

```text
read app.py
edit app.py
run the exact validation command
checkpoint after the validation observation
construct a fresh scripted model
resume to the final answer
```

Before resume, the Day 3 store already contains the edit receipt and validation
receipt. After resume, the approval log and receipt count are unchanged: neither
completed effect ran twice. The checkpoint contains no receipt IDs and makes no
exactly-once claim; it simply resumes after the conversation already says those
effects completed.

## Task 7: Keep the Boundary Small

Day 4 implements only `checkpoint.py` and two loop entry points. Future modules
are already declared in the final scaffold, but do not implement or depend on
them here. Do not add session IDs, parent pointers, rewind methods, steering
queues, disk cache files, or another checkpoint representation. If the
in-memory checkpoint is lost, start a new run.

## Checkpoint

You can now stop after a complete tool observation and continue with a fresh
scripted model from the same conversation and fake-cache position. Inspect the
checkpoint's messages and model fields, then confirm that the pre-checkpoint
edit and command remain single completed effects.

At this point, predict what resume is allowed to do: the next model response
may request a new action, but no action already represented by the saved
observation should run again. The approval and receipt counts in the focused
scenario are the falsifying evidence.

Continue with [Day 5: Compact Completed Work](week4-05-compaction.md) to derive
a smaller model-visible transcript while keeping the exact effect receipts.
The Day 5 checkpoint receives a transcript and receipts directly rather than
changing this resume path. After Day 9, the supplied Week 4 capstone composes
the two mechanisms through its deterministic orchestration.
