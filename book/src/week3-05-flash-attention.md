# 🚧 Week 3 Day 5: Paged FlashAttention

> 🚧 This chapter is under review and may change.

In this chapter, you will replace the correctness-first implementation
for the supported BF16 long-prefill hot case with paged FlashAttention. The
operator still translates logical K/V positions through `block_table`, but it
now stages page-backed tiles on chip and combines them with online softmax.
Short decode and shapes outside the optimized region keep their correct Day 4
fallbacks.

Day 5 starts differently from an ordinary correctness checkpoint: the public
behavior tests may already pass with your Day 4 implementation. That is
intentional. Your work is to make the optimized path real and reachable while
preserving the same observable behavior. The manual control-flow trace at the
end of the chapter is the completion feedback for that performance change; it
is guidance, not a hidden grading requirement.

This is a required chapter. FlashAttention belongs here rather than in Week 2
because the serving model's real K/V source is now the page pool. Building a
dense-only kernel first would create a second attention path and then require
students to relearn its memory schedule around page translation.

## Prerequisites

This chapter combines four prerequisites:

- Week 2 Day 5 introduced the online-softmax recurrence.
- Week 2 Day 6 introduced the cooperative 32×32 tile built from BF16 8×8
  SIMD-matrix fragments.
- Week 3 Day 3 introduced physical pages and block tables.
- Week 3 Day 4 introduced direct page-walking attention and the decode
  schedule.

No new model dtype is introduced here. Preserve the Week 2 precision contract
at the `paged_attention` boundary.

## Why Optimize the Paged Path

A conventional attention expression materializes a score matrix with shape
`L × S`. A page-walking implementation can avoid gathering K/V and still make
that intermediate too large. Paged FlashAttention does both:

1. it resolves each K/V tile through `block_table` instead of gathering a dense
   cache;
2. it keeps only a query tile, one K/V tile, and online-softmax state on chip;
3. it writes the normalized output once after all visible pages are consumed.

The algorithm remains numerically equivalent attention under the course's BF16
rounding tolerance. Only the order of loads and reductions changes.

## Keep the Day 4 Interface

Do not add a second model-facing operator. Continue to call:

```python
paged_attention(
    query,
    key_pages,
    value_pages,
    block_table,
    context_lens,
    page_size,
    scale=scale,
    mask="causal",
)
```

The reference solution puts this shape dispatch inside the extension:

| Query shape | Schedule |
|---|---|
| `L <= 8` | Keep the Day 4 vector paged-decode kernel. |
| `L > 8`, BF16, `D == 128` | Use the tiled paged FlashAttention kernel. |
| Every other supported shape | Keep a correct direct page-walking fallback. |

The completed Week 3 model therefore has one paged-attention contract and an
optimized BF16 long-prefill region. The public tests do not grade a kernel
name, dispatch threshold, tile shape, private route flag, helper, or source
layout. A behaviorally equivalent implementation, including one built with an
external low-level library, is valid.

## Task 1: Tile Queries and Paged K/V

The reference walkthrough begins `paged_attention_mma_bf16_d128` in
`src/extensions/src/paged_attention.metal`. Keep
`paged_attention_decode`, `paged_attention_scalar_f32`, and
`paged_attention_scalar_bf16` from Day 4 unchanged; they remain the short-query
and generic controls.

Use eight SIMD groups to cover a 64-row query block. Each SIMD group owns eight
query rows and represents matrix operands as 8×8 fragments. Stage 32 logical
K/V positions per iteration.

For every logical key row in a tile:

```plain
logical_position = tile_start + row
logical_page     = logical_position / page_size
slot             = logical_position % page_size
physical_page    = block_table[batch, logical_page]
address          = pages[physical_page, kv_head, slot, :]
```

Resolve the physical page while staging the tile. The matrix multiply should
not know whether two adjacent logical rows came from adjacent physical pages.

The Qwen path uses 128-token pages and a 32-token K/V tile. An aligned tile is
therefore physically contiguous even when the logical sequence as a whole is
not. Assign each thread contiguous elements through a cooperative block loader
so adjacent lanes issue coalesced reads. Keep a generic loader for a tile that
crosses a page boundary. The reference reuses the course-owned
`CooperativeTileLoader` and direct `simdgroup_matrix` fragments from Week 2 so
those mechanisms remain visible. You may choose a different internal helper or
low-level library as long as the operator retains direct page-table semantics
and equivalent public behavior.

Tail cases are required. A query block, K/V tile, final page, or context may be
partially full, and physical page ids need not be consecutive.

## Task 2: Compute Tiled Online Softmax

Continue modifying `paged_attention_mma_bf16_d128` in
`src/extensions/src/paged_attention.metal`. This task fills the tiled
online-softmax body; it does not add another public function.

For each query tile, maintain one running maximum, one running sum, and an
unnormalized output accumulator per row. For each K/V tile:

1. compute `Q @ Kᵀ` with the Week 2 SIMD-matrix fragments;
2. apply scale and causal bounds;
3. merge the tile maximum into the running maximum;
4. rescale the previous sum and output accumulator;
5. compute exponentials for the current scores and update the running sum;
6. multiply the tile probabilities by V and update the output accumulator.

After the final visible tile, divide each output row by its running sum and
store it using the model-facing dtype.

Multiply the attention scale by `log2(e)` once and use `fast::exp2` for
online-softmax rescaling inside the hot tile loop. This is mathematically
equivalent to natural exponentials and avoids repeating a base conversion.

The causal offset is `context_len - L`. A key at logical position `s` is visible
to query row `l` when:

```plain
s <= l + context_len - L
```

Skip a whole K/V tile when its first key is beyond the last visible key for the
query block. This is both a correctness rule and an important causal-prefill
optimization.

## Task 3: Validate the Page Boundary

Complete the long-query selection in `PagedAttention::eval_gpu` in
`src/extensions/src/paged_attention.cpp`, then test
`paged_attention_mma_bf16_d128` against the Day 4 kernels. Keep
`tiny_llm_ext::paged_attention` and the Python `paged_attention` signature
unchanged.

Use the GPU-debugging ladder from Week 2 Day 3:

1. compare Day 4 page-walking attention with the readable equation written
   with `mlx.core`;
2. compare paged FlashAttention with the Day 4 path;
3. trace the model-to-kernel route, then design a matched operator benchmark
   before making a speed claim.

The behavior fixtures cover:

- a context contained in one page;
- a partial query block and context tail with non-consecutive physical pages;
- poisoned unused pages and tail slots, which must not affect the result;
- batched GQA where multiple query heads map to one K/V head;
- causal and non-causal calls, including an explicit scale;
- short decode and generic BF16 head-dimension fallbacks;
- a model-level long-prefill comparison through the public Week 3 path;
- output shape and dtype, plus numerical agreement with dense attention.

These are public input/output checks. They do not inspect allocator choices,
page identifiers chosen by an implementation, kernel names, or routing state.

Force `mx.eval` immediately after each operator so compilation, dispatch, and
addressing failures are reported at the responsible call.

```bash
pdm run test --week 3 --day 5
```

If this command is green before you begin Day 5, you have confirmed that Day
4's correctness boundary is intact. Continue with the optimized implementation
and use the trace below to confirm that the supported hot case no longer takes
the scalar fallback.

## Task 4: Integrate and Measure

Verify the existing dispatch in `Qwen3MultiHeadAttention.__call__` and the
shape selection inside `PagedAttention::eval_gpu`. Task 4 adds no new
extension function.

The Week 3 model should use the tiled paged path automatically for supported
long prefills. Short queries continue through the vector paged-decode schedule.
Neither path gathers a dense K/V tensor. Canonical Week 3 uses MLX quantized
projections, but its cache, paged attention, batching, and scheduling remain
course-owned. This hybrid course path is not the full-MLX baseline.

The checked continuous-serving trace is useful system context, but it is not a
matched scalar-versus-tiled Day 5 experiment. The current model-free runner
also lacks that isolated long-BF16 comparison. Do not claim a Day 5 speedup
from these rows. A separate benchmark follow-up should hold inputs, page tables,
precision, warmup, synchronization, and every non-attention mechanism fixed
while changing only the scalar-versus-tiled schedule.

Run the cumulative system check on your solution:

```bash
pdm run bench-serving-progression --solution tiny_llm --offline --repeats 4 \
  --model qwen3-4b --num-seqs 16 --batch-size 4 \
  --min-input-len 128 --max-input-len 1024 \
  --min-output-len 32 --max-output-len 128 --prefill-step 128 \
  --warmup 1 --cooldown-seconds 1 \
  --json-output benchmark_results/task367-final-main/raw/learner-week3-serving.json
```

The table below is checked reference evidence. Reproduce it separately with
`--solution ref` and
`--json-output benchmark_results/task367-final-main/raw/week3-serving-final-main.json`.

FlashAttention is expected to matter more as prefill grows. Treat that as a
hypothesis until a matched operator benchmark measures it. It should not
replace the Day 4 decode schedule: a one-token query has no query-tile reuse.

On the checked M4 Pro trace, all three course rows share the same projection
seam:

| Storage / attention path | Prefill tok/s | Output tok/s | Decode tok/s | Requests/s | Peak KV | Avoidable KV copy |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Dense growth and reconstruction | 711.18 | 35.23 | 57.59 | 0.469 | 1,096 MiB | 209,532 MiB |
| Paged storage + dense gather | 725.46 | 41.64 | 78.53 | 0.555 | not a total peak | 103,445 MiB |
| Direct paged attention | 672.68 | 46.36 | 105.01 | 0.618 | 576 MiB | 504 MiB |

Relative to dense serving, direct paging is 5.4% lower on prefill, 31.6%
higher on output/request throughput, 82.3% higher on decode, 47.4% lower on
measured peak KV storage, and 99.76% lower on avoidable logical copy volume.
The compatibility row's page-pool counter excludes its temporary dense staging
allocation, so it is not a total peak. These are cumulative Week 3 system
results; they do not isolate the Day 5 prefill schedule from paging, direct
decode, allocation, or scheduling, and they do not credit the MLX projection
seam to paged attention.

The existing 8K static sweep is another cumulative diagnostic. It does not
isolate scalar versus tiled paged attention, measure request turnover, page
reuse, or capacity. The
[performance appendix](./appendix-performance.md) records the matched serving
and long-context measurements. Long-context decode remains a Day 4 vector
kernel workload; do not credit a prefill schedule with a decode gain.

```bash
pdm run bench-course-progression --solution tiny_llm --offline --suite course \
  --variant week2 --variant week3 --variant mlx --model qwen3-4b \
  --input-len 8192 --output-len 2 --prefill-logits last \
  --warmup 1 --repeats 4 --cooldown-seconds 1 \
  --json-output benchmark_results/task367-final-main/raw/learner-week3-8k.json
```

This command measures your Week 2 and Week 3 course rows while retaining MLX
as the library baseline. The checked table below is reference evidence;
reproduce it separately with `--solution ref` and
`--json-output benchmark_results/task367-final-main/raw/week3-8k-final-main.json`.

| 8K static checkpoint | Prefill tok/s | Decode tok/s |
|---|---:|---:|
| Week 2 course-owned projections | 323.96 | 17.73 |
| Week 3 seam + course paged path | 463.69 | 27.42 |
| Full MLX | 639.73 | 28.37 |

The cumulative Week 3 row is 43.1% faster than the cumulative Week 2 row and
reaches 72.5% of full MLX at this shape. This remains a static diagnostic: it
does not measure request turnover, page reuse, admission capacity, the
projection seam, or the Day 5 schedule causally. Its decode row is the Day 4
vector schedule, not evidence for the tiled prefill kernel. Full method and raw
samples are in
`benchmark_results/task367-final-main/task367-final-main-benchmark-ledger.md`.

> Trace the actual control flow for Week 3 long-prefill paged attention. First determine whether the implementation stays in this repository or crosses into an external low-level library. For a repository implementation, start at the Python model call and follow native dispatch into Metal. For an external implementation, trace from the Python model call to the library boundary and record equivalent boundary evidence, including the call site, arguments, and selected backend. Determine whether BF16 queries with L > 8 and D == 128 reach the learner's optimized tiled or FlashAttention-equivalent implementation rather than the correctness fallback. Verify that short decode and unsupported or generic shapes retain correct fallback behavior. Cite file and line evidence for repository code and equivalent boundary evidence for external code, flag dead or unreachable paths, judge control flow rather than function or kernel names, and report findings only—do not modify files.
