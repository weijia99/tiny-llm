# 🚧 Week 3 Day 3: Paged KV Cache

> 🚧 This chapter is under review and may change.

In this chapter, we will design the **paged KV cache**, the storage abstraction
behind paged attention. Continuous batching creates many request-owned caches
with different lifetimes and sequence lengths. Storing each cache as one
growing tensor makes every append depend on a contiguous allocation and makes
batch construction revisit historical K/V.

Fixed-size pages separate a sequence's logical order from its physical
placement. The runtime can append, release, and reuse storage without moving a
request's complete history. This chapter changes the storage layout first and
uses dense attention as a correctness checkpoint. Day 4 will read the pages
directly.

## Why the Dense KV Layout Becomes Expensive

Right now, the mental model looks like this:

```plain
request A -> one dense KV tensor
request B -> one dense KV tensor
request C -> one dense KV tensor
```

Before attention, the runtime repacks them into:

```plain
keys:   [B, H, S_max, D]
values: [B, H, S_max, D]
mask:   [B, 1, L, S_max]
```

The trouble is that decode only adds a tiny amount of new information each step, but the dense layout keeps revisiting old KV.

For example, if a request already has 17 cached tokens and we decode 1 more token:

```plain
new useful work: append 1 token
dense repack view: rebuild 18 logical positions
```

For one request this is fine. For many live requests, the runtime spends more and more time moving previously computed KV instead of doing actual model work.

## The Page Abstraction

Instead of storing each layer's KV for a request as one long tensor, we divide storage into fixed-size **pages**:

```plain
key_pages:   pages with up to page_size token slots
value_pages: pages with up to page_size token slots
```

Each layer cache keeps a small page table:

```plain
page_ids = [12, 5, 3]
context_len = 10
```

That means:

```plain
page 12 -> tokens 0..3
page  5 -> tokens 4..7
page  3 -> tokens 8..9
```

The logical sequence is still length 10. The difference is that the runtime is no longer forced to represent it as one contiguous tensor.

The model owns one physical **page
pool per transformer layer**. Request caches for the same layer share its pool,
while every request-and-layer cache keeps its own `page_ids`, `page_lens`, and
`offset`. A page id is therefore local to one layer, matching the K/V storage
buffer that the attention kernel receives.

`page_size` is the physical page capacity. Unused tail slots are not part of
the logical sequence; `page_lens` decides which prefix of each page is valid.

## Why Fixed-Size Pages Help

The page abstraction gives us two immediate wins:

1. Appending a token usually updates only the current tail page in the pool.
2. Finished requests can return their pages to the layer's shared free list.

This is the key memory-management idea behind paged attention systems such as vLLM.

## Data Structures We Need

### 1. `PagePool`

The model should own one pool per layer, each with a free-page allocator and
flat K/V page storage:

```plain
free_pages: available page ids for this layer
keys[page_id]:   physical key page
values[page_id]: physical value page
```

Requests share physical storage only when they are executing the same layer.
Layer 0 and layer 1 may both use page ids `[0, 1]` because those ids address
different buffers. Keeping the layer dimension outside `page_id` prevents a
one-token write in one layer from copying or serializing the page storage for
every other layer.

The backing slab should grow geometrically rather than by exactly one page.
Keep logical `num_pages` separate from physical capacity so callers still see
only allocated pages while pool growth copies old storage logarithmically many
times.

Growing an exact-size slab from `p` to `p + 1` pages copies approximately
`1 + 2 + ... + p` old pages, which is quadratic in the final page count.
Starting with four pages and doubling capacity copies fewer than twice the
eventual capacity across all growth events. Splitting the slab by transformer
layer also prevents a new page in layer 0 from replacing the storage object
used by every other layer. These two changes amortize allocator-copy work so
most new-page allocations do not copy old pages, without changing the logical
page table.

Implement this abstraction as `TinyKvPagedPool`.

### 2. `PagedRequestCache`

A layer cache for one request should track:

- `page_ids`
- `page_lens`
- `offset`
- `page_size`

Derived values:

- `num_pages = len(page_ids)`
- `context_len = offset`
- `last_page_fill = page_lens[-1]` when at least one page exists

Implement the request view as `TinyKvPagedCache`. Create it with a pool from
the model; it should not allocate its own pool,
because that would isolate one request from the shared page allocator.

Create one `TinyKvPagedCache` per transformer layer. Caches for different
requests share a layer pool, but they do not share metadata: each cache owns
its own `page_ids`, `page_lens`, and `offset`.

### 3. Tail-Append Logic

When new K/V arrives for one layer:

1. look at that layer cache's last page
2. if there is room, append only the new slice into the tail page
3. otherwise allocate a new page and continue writing
4. update cache metadata such as `page_lens` and `offset`

This replaces the dense-cache pattern of repeatedly concatenating along the sequence dimension.

#### Make write cost proportional to the appended slice

MLX arrays are functional and lazily evaluated. Writing
`pages[page_id, :, start:end, :] = values` may build an update whose output is
the entire page tensor; a small slice in Python does not guarantee a
slice-sized device update.

Implement `paged_cache_update` as a small extension primitive in your solution.
Its output aliases the existing page buffer, and its Metal grid
covers only `H * new_tokens * D` elements. Page storage is request state, so
this mutation boundary is explicit and safe as long as the cache owns its page
and attention depends on the returned array. Full-buffer copies remain only
when geometric capacity grows.

The learner extension already contains the C++ and Metal source files, CMake
entries, header declaration, and Python binding. Replace the
`paged_cache_update` stubs in `src/extensions/src/paged_attention.cpp` and
`src/extensions/src/paged_attention.metal`; do not create or register a second
primitive.

Then rebuild:

```bash
pdm run build-ext
```

Test this behavior through the cache interface: append across a tail-page
boundary, grow the slab, release and reuse page ids, and compare the gathered
logical sequence with `TinyKvFullCache`.

## Prefill with Pages

Suppose `page_size = 4` and one prefill chunk contains 6 tokens:

```plain
chunk = [t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5]
```

One possible layout is:

```plain
page 7 <- [t0 t1 t2 t3]
page 2 <- [t4 t5]        # 2 valid tokens, 2 unused slots of capacity
```

That layer cache's metadata becomes:

```plain
page_ids = [7, 2]
context_len = 6
```

The important property is that a later decode token can be appended to page `2` without touching page `7`.

## Decode with Pages

During decode, each live request adds one token at a time.

With paged storage:

1. compute one-token `k` and `v`
2. check whether the tail page still has space
3. write into that page if possible
4. allocate a new page only when the old one is full

So if `page_size = 4` and `context_len = 9`:

```plain
page_ids = [12, 5, 3]
```

Appending token 9 only updates the last page instead of rebuilding all earlier KV.

## Correctness Checkpoint: Gather Pages for Dense Attention

The cleanest first implementation is **paged storage with dense gather**.

That means:

- pages in each layer pool are the source of truth,
- layer caches stop owning one monolithic K/V tensor,
- layer caches only track page metadata,
- attention still receives dense K/V reconstructed from pages.

This checkpoint isolates the storage and lifecycle work before adding indirect
GPU reads:

- page allocation and reuse can be tested independently;
- the gathered sequence can be compared directly with `TinyKvFullCache`;
- copy counters establish the cost that direct page traversal should remove.

## How This Maps to `tiny-llm`

### `src/tiny_llm/paged_kv_cache.py`

Add:

- `TinyKvPagedPool`
- `TinyKvPagedCache`

Keep `TinyKvFullCache` in `src/tiny_llm/kv_cache.py` as a baseline and test
oracle.

The chapter's execution path is:

1. write new K/V into the layer cache's tail page or newly allocated pages,
2. gather the layer cache's pages back into dense K/V,
3. feed that dense K/V into the readable dense attention equation.

This chapter changes the storage model while preserving the dense attention
equation as a correctness oracle.

### `src/tiny_llm/batch.py`

Requests should own per-layer cache handles instead of long dense K/V tensors.

The scheduler should still:

- perform chunked prefill,
- hold active requests,
- free cache pages when a slot finishes.

The difference is that freeing a request now means releasing all pages owned by its layer caches back to the pool.

Add a small `rewind(n)` lifecycle hook. Rewind lets a caller remove the newest
logical tokens without rebuilding the retained prefix. It frees whole pages
that are no longer needed and shortens the valid length of the final remaining
page. The optional speculative-decoding chapter will use this operation when
drafted tokens are rejected.

## Design Questions

Before implementing, make sure the following are clear:

1. What page size should this repo use for teaching?
2. How do we represent the free-page allocator?
3. How do we prove that paged storage reconstructs the same logical KV as `TinyKvFullCache`?
4. How do request cache handles share a layer pool while keeping their own page metadata?
5. When do we materialize page writes to avoid MLX lazy-graph growth?
6. How do we grow physical capacity without copying all old pages on every allocation?

## Task 1: Design `PagePool`

```
src/tiny_llm/paged_kv_cache.py
```

Modify `TinyKvPagedPool.__init__`, `allocate_page`, `write_page_slice`, and
`free_page` in this task. For the slice-sized device
write, replace the Week 3 Day 3 stubs `tiny_llm_ext::paged_cache_update`,
`PagedCacheUpdate::eval_cpu`, and `PagedCacheUpdate::eval_gpu` in
`src/extensions/src/paged_attention.cpp`, and implement
`paged_cache_update_kernel` in `src/extensions/src/paged_attention.metal`.
Their declaration, binding, source/Metal files, and CMake registration already
exist; do not create a second paged-cache API.

Design layer-owned page pools that:

- own a free-page allocator,
- store flat fixed-size K/V pages,
- allocates and frees page ids,
- supports writing a chunk into page storage,
- grows backing capacity geometrically,
- updates only the appended physical slice between growth events,
- is shared by all request caches for that layer, but not by other layers.

Test logical size and physical capacity separately. Allocating the fifth page,
for example, may create capacity for eight pages, but `key_pages` and
`value_pages` exposed to the attention runtime should contain only the five
allocated page ids.

## Task 2: Design `PagedRequestCache`

```
src/tiny_llm/paged_kv_cache.py
```

Modify `TinyKvPagedCache.__init__`, `update_and_fetch`, `release`, and
`rewind`. Use `TinyKvPagedPool.write_page_slice` from Task 1 for
every physical append.

Replace the "one layer cache = one dense KV tensor" model with:

- `page_ids`
- `context_len`
- append logic over fixed-size pages
- `release()` for returning pages on request completion
- `rewind(n)` for dropping the newest `n` logical tokens

## Task 3: Add a Dense-Gather Compatibility Path

```
src/tiny_llm/paged_kv_cache.py
src/tiny_llm/qwen3_week3.py
```

Modify `TinyKvPagedCache.gather_dense` in
`src/tiny_llm/paged_kv_cache.py`, plus `Qwen3ModelWeek3.__init__`,
`Qwen3ModelWeek3.create_kv_cache`, and `Qwen3MultiHeadAttention.__call__` in
`src/tiny_llm/qwen3_week3.py`. This checkpoint deliberately does not implement
`paged_attention`; Day 4 owns that function.

Carry forward Day 1's projection boundary when constructing the dense Qwen3
model: quantized projections use the `mx.quantized_matmul` seam, while the
embedding lookup, normalization, activation, RoPE, cache, and attention paths
remain course-owned. Keep `use_mlx_quantized_linear=True` as the dense Week 3
default and retain the opt-out only as a benchmark/correctness ablation. The
optional MoE extension keeps its separately taught router/expert projection
contract; do not silently broaden this dense-model seam into that chapter.

Build a compatibility path that reconstructs dense K/V from pages and compares it against `TinyKvFullCache`.

This gives us a correctness check before we change the attention path itself.
Instantiate the Week 3 model with `enable_paged_attention=False` in this
chapter so its attention reads the gathered dense tensors. Day 4 switches the
same model to page-table metadata and the paged kernel.

Run that cumulative checkpoint through the normal generation and benchmark
entry points:

```bash
pdm run main --solution tiny_llm --loader week3 \
  --disable-paged-attention --model qwen3-0.6b

pdm run bench --solution tiny_llm --loader week3 \
  --disable-paged-attention --batch-decode --model qwen3-0.6b
```

In the next chapter, we will take the next step: instead of gathering dense K/V before attention, we will pass runtime metadata such as `block_table` directly into a paged attention path.

## What Paging Changes

Apple silicon's unified memory removes the discrete-device transfer boundary,
but it does not remove allocation, fragmentation, or copying inside the
GPU-visible heap.
Fixed-size pages still let a server reuse freed capacity, grow requests without
reserving their maximum sequence length, and batch requests with different
context lengths. These are useful lifecycle mechanisms, but a fixed-batch trace
measures KV-storage headroom rather than admission capacity. Claiming that more
requests can be admitted requires a separate memory-capped sweep.

Report fragmentation with an aligned numerator and denominator. The benchmark
finds the snapshot with the largest sum of unused slots in the final live page
of every request/layer cache, then divides that sum by all token slots in live
pages at the same snapshot. It reports the unused-slot bytes as well. Unused
physical pool capacity is excluded from that fraction and remains visible in
the separate live-page and capacity-page counters.

```bash
pdm run test --week 3 --day 3
```
