# Day 1: A Validated Agent Loop

Weeks 1 through 3 built a function that turns a conversation into model text.
A coding agent needs a small control loop around that function: ask for one
response, decide whether it is a final answer or an action, record what
happened, and continue when an action produces an observation.

Start with one prediction: if the model first requests a disabled tool and then
returns malformed JSON, which requests reach the workspace, which errors enter
the next model input, and which configured budget can stop the run first? The
event trace at the end of this chapter lets you check every part of that answer.

The model never edits a file directly. It emits text. Ordinary Python validates
that text before handing a parsed action to a workspace object. This separation
makes the loop deterministic to test even when no model weights are loaded.

## The Teaching Boundary

Day 1 teaches only a bounded loop and one JSON action protocol. The supplied
test uses a fake workspace with one enabled read-only action. Real project
inspection arrives on Day 2; file mutation, command execution, approval, and
durable receipts arrive later.

The loop validates and records a model response, but it does not prove that the
model solved the task. It is also not a sandbox, background worker, persistent
session, or production scheduler.

## Files and Public Surface

The repository is a final Day 9 declaration scaffold. Future agent modules and
exports are already visible, but their implementation surfaces are not part of
Day 1. Most later bodies are TODO stubs; Day 9 also contains one explicitly
supplied constructor check. Implement only the following surfaces:

Implement the TODO bodies in these Day 1 starter files:

| File | Public names | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/tiny_llm/agent/generation.py` | `initial_messages`, `generate_response` | Begin a conversation and keep one model-response boundary explicit. |
| `src/tiny_llm/agent/protocol.py` | `AgentError`, `FinalAction`, `ToolAction`, `parse_action`, `build_system_prompt` | Represent and validate one final answer or one enabled tool request. |
| `src/tiny_llm/agent/loop.py` | `AgentLimits`, `AgentEvent`, `AgentRun`, `run_agent` | Bound a run, propagate observations, and retain an inspectable trace. |

`generate_response()` remains part of the public Day 1 surface. It renders the
messages with the course tokenizer, decodes at most `max_tokens` with a fresh
cache, stops at EOS, and releases every cache in a `finally` block.

The supplied Day 1 test checks `generate_response()` with the course tokenizer
and model boundary: exact prompt and thinking offsets, EOS stopping, the token
limit, a fresh cache for each call, and cache release on normal and exceptional
paths. The `pdm run agent` CLI still uses its own MLX-LM generation adapter, so
a successful live CLI run is not evidence for this helper; the cumulative Day
1 checkpoint is.

Run the cumulative learner checkpoint from the repository root:

```bash
pdm run test --week 4 --day 1
```

The command force-refreshes the supplied Day 1 learner test before running it.
Before you implement the TODOs, the implementation-dependent cases across ten
task groups are expected to fail. No model download is required.

Course maintainers can check the supplied implementation without copying the
learner test:

```bash
pdm run test-refsol --week 4 --day 1
```

## Task 1: Start the Conversation Deliberately

`initial_messages(task, system_prompt)` creates the first two messages:

```python
[
    {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
    {"role": "user", "content": task},
]
```

Reject an empty or whitespace-only task. `build_system_prompt(workspace)`
describes only the actions enabled for this run. The prompt is guidance, not
enforcement: the protocol and workspace boundary must still reject anything
the policy does not allow.

## Task 2: Execute One Tool and Finish

`run_agent(task, generate, workspace, limits=None)` starts from those messages.
The test injects a `generate` callable that returns predetermined strings, so
the control flow stays deterministic.

For a valid tool action, call `workspace.execute(action)`, record the action and
result, and append both the assistant response and a user observation. When a
later response is a valid `FinalAction`, return a completed `AgentRun` with the
final text.

## Task 3: Validate One Structured Decision

A model response is exactly one JSON object. It is either a final answer:

```json
{"final":"I inspected README.md."}
```

or one tool request:

```json
{"tool":"read_file","path":"README.md"}
```

`parse_action()` rejects malformed JSON, non-object values, blank final text,
unknown or disabled tools, missing fields, unexpected fields, and fields with
the wrong shape. Do not ignore trailing or extra data.

`TOOL_FIELDS` names the cumulative vocabulary: `list_files`, `read_file`,
`write_file`, `edit_file`, and `run_command`. Day 1 implements none of those
effects. Its fake workspace enables only `read_file`, which is enough to prove
that availability is checked before dispatch.

Malformed or unavailable actions become ordinary `error:` observations. The
model can see the failure and choose another response instead of crashing the
Python loop.

## Task 4: Stop at the Step Budget

`AgentLimits.max_steps` bounds how many model decisions one run may attempt.
When the loop consumes that budget without a valid final answer, return an
incomplete run whose reason is `step_limit`. The events show exactly how the
budget was spent.

## Task 5: Return an Inspectable Run

Every interaction becomes an `AgentEvent` with the step number, raw response,
parsed action when one exists, and result or validation error. `AgentRun`
records the completion flag, stop reason, optional final answer, and immutable
event tuple.

A run marked `completed` means only that the model returned a valid final
action. Later days add receipts and outcome evaluation; Day 1 keeps the trace
small and in memory.

## Task 6: Recover from Invalid JSON

After an invalid response, append the raw assistant response and its exact
validation error as the next user observation. Reset the identical-action
counter, then let the model try again while the invalid-action budget remains.

The focused case sends invalid JSON followed by a valid final response. The
first event must retain the recoverable error, and the second must complete the
run.

## Task 7: Stop Repeated Actions

Serialize each parsed tool name and normalized argument object into a stable
signature. Count consecutive identical requests and stop with
`repeated_action_limit` when the count exceeds the configured budget.

This guard matters even when a tool succeeds: repeating the same request can
consume the whole run without adding new information.

## Task 8: Preserve the Exact Observation

The next model call must receive the complete tool result, not only a marker:

```python
{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Tool result:\nREADME contents",
}
```

The normal guard fails if that payload is changed or dropped. It also proves
that a known-but-disabled tool such as `write_file` becomes an error
observation and never reaches the fake workspace.

## Task 9: Make Every Limit Fail Closed

Require positive values for `max_steps`, `max_context_chars`,
`max_invalid_actions`, and `max_identical_actions`. Zero or negative budgets
would disable the intended stopping guarantee and must be rejected.

Before each model call, bound the total message-content characters and stop
with `context_limit` when it is too large. Count invalid actions and stop with
`invalid_action_limit` when that budget is exhausted. Together with the step
and repeated-action limits, every run has an explicit terminal reason.

## Checkpoint

When Day 1 is green, inspect the focused test rather than only its final pass:
confirm the initial system/user pair, one dispatched `read_file`, the exact
observation in the next model input, the completed final event, and each
budgeted stop reason. Revisit your opening prediction: a disabled or malformed
request must not reach the workspace, and the exact error must remain visible
to the following model turn.

This checkpoint proves the scripted protocol and loop, plus the focused
`generate_response()` model/cache boundary. It does not make the separate
real-model CLI exercise that helper.

You now have a validated, bounded model → action → observation loop. Continue
with [Day 2: Inspect a Workspace](week4-02-tools.md) to replace the fake tool
boundary with real contained directory listing and UTF-8 file reads.
