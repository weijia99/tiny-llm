# 🚧 Week 3 Day 2: Chunked Prefill

> 🚧 This chapter is under review and may change.

A long prompt can monopolize the device while active decode requests wait for
their next token. Chunked prefill gives each scheduler iteration a prompt-token
budget, limiting how long decode work can be delayed.

The scheduler policy becomes:

```plain
admit at most prefill_max_step prompt tokens
decode one token for every active request
repeat until the queue and active batch are empty
```

## Task 1: Bound Prefill Work

Update `Request.try_prefill` in `src/tiny_llm/batch.py` to select one prompt
slice, call the model with the slice's absolute offset, and mark the request
ready only after the full prompt has been processed.

```python
for start in range(0, len(prompt_tokens), prefill_max_step):
    chunk = prompt_tokens[start : start + prefill_max_step]
    model(chunk, offset=start, cache=cache)
```

The final chunk may be smaller than the configured budget. Test prompts shorter
than one chunk, exactly one chunk, and one token longer than a chunk.

## Task 2: Build Rectangular Causal Masks

When a cache already holds `S - L` tokens and a chunk contributes `L` new
tokens, the mask is `L x S`. Every query can attend to the old prefix and to
earlier positions in its own chunk.

For a five-token prefix and a three-token chunk, the mask is `3 x 8`:

```plain
0  0  0  0  0  0  -inf  -inf
0  0  0  0  0  0     0  -inf
0  0  0  0  0  0     0     0
```

Use the absolute cache offset for RoPE and `S - L` as the causal diagonal
offset. Compare chunked prefill logits with one-shot prefill logits.

## Task 3: Materialize Between Chunks

MLX is lazy. Extending an unevaluated cache repeatedly creates a long graph and
can grow memory usage. Call each layer cache's `materialize()` hook after every
chunk so the next scheduler iteration starts from materialized state. A dense
cache evaluates its key/value tuple; a paged cache evaluates the page pool
storage without first gathering it into a dense tensor.

The hook is part of the cache lifecycle rather than the scheduler's storage
logic. This lets the scheduler use dense and paged caches without inspecting
their internal representation.

## Task 4: Measure the Fairness Tradeoff

Run the same request trace with several `prefill_max_step` values. Report total
throughput and the longest interval between consecutive decode steps. Smaller
chunks usually improve fairness but add scheduler and launch overhead; choose a
default from the measured tradeoff rather than treating one chunk size as
universal.

```bash
pdm run test --week 3 --day 2
pdm run batch-main --solution tiny_llm --loader week2

pdm run bench-chunked-prefill --solution tiny_llm --offline --model qwen3-0.6b \
  --prefill-steps 32 128 512 --num-seqs 8 --batch-size 4 \
  --min-input-len 64 --max-input-len 512 \
  --min-output-len 32 --max-output-len 32 \
  --warmup 1 --repeats 4 --cooldown-seconds 1 \
  --json-output benchmark_results/task367-final-main/raw/learner-week3-chunked-prefill.json
```

This command measures your `tiny_llm` solution. The checked reference trace
below uses seed 0 and the same 32-token output budget for every
request. Each chunk size runs twice in forward order and twice in reverse order
in fresh processes. Every row uses the same canonical Week 3 MLX
quantized-projection seam and the same course-owned scheduler, dense cache, and
attention code; only the prefill budget changes. The JSON stores every prompt
token id, the per-request output budget, and their canonical SHA-256 checksum.
To reproduce the checked rows separately, rerun the command with
`--solution ref` and
`--json-output benchmark_results/task367-final-main/raw/week3-chunked-prefill-final-main.json`.

A decode-completion gap is the wall-clock interval between two consecutive
synchronized decode calls while at least one decode request remains active. It
therefore includes intervening prefill and scheduler work; idle time with no
decode request is excluded. On the measured M4 Pro, the four-process medians
were:

| Prefill budget | Output tok/s | Prefill tok/s | Decode tok/s | Requests/s | Decode step p95 | Decode gap p95 / max |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 32 | 105.23 | 2,549.62 | 181.77 | 3.288 | 15.82 ms | 30.01 / 52.62 ms |
| 128 | 153.82 | 4,215.12 | 242.23 | 4.807 | 17.79 ms | 45.36 / 53.76 ms |
| 512 | 170.46 | 4,769.14 | 262.01 | 5.327 | 17.11 ms | 73.56 / 119.90 ms |

The 512-token row is the full-prompt Day 1 control for this trace. Relative to
that row, the 128-token budget gives up 9.8% output throughput while reducing
the p95 completion gap by 38.3% and the maximum gap by 55.2%. The 32-token
budget reduces the p95 gap further but gives up substantially more throughput.
The course uses 128 as a measured compromise for this workload, not as a
universal optimum. The ledger at
`benchmark_results/task367-final-main/task367-final-main-benchmark-ledger.md`
keeps this final-main absolute result separate from task #360's causal
projection-seam ablation.
