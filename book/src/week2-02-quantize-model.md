# 🚧 Week 2 Day 2: Keep W4 Packed

Complete [Day 1: Cache and Measure](./week2-01-kv-cache.md) first. Its
`capacity-cache` checkpoint gives you a matched cached-model baseline, bounded
dense K/V storage, and a decode roofline. Keep that baseline fixed while changing the
projection representation. The Day 2 starter
already supplies the packed-weight container and its
`QuantizedWeights.from_mlx_layer` loader, the extension declaration and
binding, fail-closed C++/Metal stubs, and cumulative model switches. Your work
is to:

1. dequantize selected embedding rows without expanding the full table;
2. define the lazy quantized-matmul primitive and its validation boundary;
3. implement the readable Metal matrix control and the decode-shaped SIMD
   matvec; and
4. wire packed projections and the tied output head into the live cached model.

Build the learner and reference extensions before running Day 2's native
tests. Begin with the Python wrapper gate, then exercise the GPU operator:

```bash
pdm run build-ext
pdm run build-ext-ref
pdm run test --week 2 --day 2 -- -k task_1
pdm run test --week 2 --day 2 -- -k gpu
```

Finish with the complete Day 2 gate and the `quantized-matvec` model
checkpoint. The result is complete only when the cached model dispatches
through your quantized path; packed storage and an isolated fast kernel are
intermediate steps.

## Debug Metal Without a CPU Twin

You do not need a C++ CPU twin. Bring up the operator with this three-level
validation ladder:

1. Write the equation in Python with `mlx.core`. This is the semantic oracle.
2. Translate it into a deliberately simple Metal kernel, usually with one
   thread responsible for one output element.
3. Optimize the validated Metal kernel with SIMD groups, vectorized loads, or
   SIMD-group matrix operations.

Compare each level with the one immediately above it. Full-model text output
is too indirect to diagnose an optimized kernel.

### Make Failures Small and Synchronous

Use deterministic fixtures whose expected values are easy to inspect: zeros,
ones, ramps, identity-like weights, and a fixed random seed. Exercise a small
aligned shape and then a tail shape. For example, test 8 and 10 rows for an
8-row tile, or sequence lengths 32 and 35 for a 32-token block.

MLX execution is lazy, so force evaluation directly after the operator under
test. This turns a delayed compile or GPU execution failure into a failure at
the responsible call site:

```python
expected = python_reference(*inputs)
actual = metal_operator(*inputs)
mx.eval(expected, actual)

assert actual.shape == expected.shape
assert actual.dtype == mx.bfloat16
assert mx.allclose(actual, expected, rtol=2e-2, atol=2e-2).item()
```

When a check fails, inspect the wrapper boundary before the arithmetic. Assert
the tensor rank, shape, dtype, and contiguity assumptions in Python or C++, and
verify that the encoded buffer indices match the Metal function signature.
Then classify the failure:

- a pipeline creation error usually means the kernel name, specialization, or
  Metal compilation is wrong;
- an execution or address error usually means a grid, bounds check, stride, or
  buffer binding is wrong;
- a finite but inaccurate result usually means the indexing, reduction, mask,
  dequantization, or accumulator update is wrong.

For a numerical mismatch, simplify the schedule temporarily. Assign one output
to one thread, remove cooperative loads, and compare an intermediate such as a
dequantized weight group, a partial dot product, or an online-softmax row. A
small debug-only output buffer is usually more useful than printing from every
GPU thread. Restore one optimization at a time, rerunning the aligned and
tail-shape tests after each change.

## Represent Weights With Fewer Bits

**Quantization** stores each floating-point weight as a value from a small
integer codebook plus the parameters needed to reconstruct an approximation.
This course uses **weight-only 4-bit quantization**:

- **W4** means that each logical weight is represented by a 4-bit code.
- **A16** means that activations and outputs remain 16-bit floating point.
- The resulting path is called **W4A16**. This course uses BF16 for its
  activations, scales, biases, and outputs.

The 16 possible codes approximate the original values. In return for some
numerical precision, the smaller representation reduces memory traffic.

The kernel does not materialize a dense BF16 weight matrix. It unpacks each
4-bit code, reconstructs the weight in registers, and immediately multiplies
it by the corresponding BF16 activation.

### Group-Wise Affine Quantization

Rather than applying one scale to an entire weight matrix, divide each row into
**groups** and quantize each group independently. A local scale and bias retain
more information about that group's weight distribution.

For a weight matrix `W` of shape `(K, N)`, divide each row into groups of size
`G`. The Qwen3-4B MLX 4-bit checkpoint used in this course has a fixed group
size of 128:

```plain
Logical weight matrix W: K × N

Group size: G = 128
Number of groups per row = N / G

For each stored group of G consecutive values in a row:
  1. Unpack each unsigned 4-bit code q in [0, 15]
  2. Load the group's stored scale s and bias b
  3. Reconstruct each value as q * s + b
```

### Reconstruct a Stored Group

The checkpoint already contains packed codes and affine parameters. For an
unpacked unsigned code `q`, use the stored scale `s` and bias `b` directly:

$$
\hat{w} = q s + b
$$

Read the equation as: reconstructed weight equals the unsigned code `q`
multiplied by its stored signed scale `s`, plus its stored bias `b`.

The codes are unsigned, but the stored scale is signed. A positive scale maps
code 0 to the lower endpoint and code 15 toward the upper endpoint. A negative
scale reverses the mapping: code 0 is the upper endpoint and code 15 moves
toward the lower endpoint. Both orientations occur in the shipped Qwen3-4B MLX
checkpoint. Use `scale` and `bias` as stored instead of reconstructing them from
an assumed min/max orientation.

For example, these two stored parameter pairs reconstruct the same endpoint
range in opposite code order:

```plain
positive orientation: scale =  0.0867, bias = -0.5  => q=0 is -0.5, q=15 is about 0.8
negative orientation: scale = -0.0867, bias =  0.8  => q=0 is  0.8, q=15 is about -0.5
```

All required quantized-matmul tests use `group_size = 128` and BF16 scales,
biases, activations, and outputs. Normalize those tensors to BF16 in your
solution's model loader so every later kernel receives one model dtype.

### Packed Storage Layout

The 4-bit codes are packed for compact storage and efficient access:

```plain
Logical weight matrix: K × N
Dense BF16 storage: K × N bfloat16 (2 bytes each) = 2KN bytes
W4 code storage: K × N int4 (0.5 bytes each) = 0.5KN bytes

Packing: 8 × 4-bit values fit in one uint32 (32 bits)

Packed codes shape: K × (N / 8) uint32
Scales shape: K × (N / G) bfloat16
Biases shape: K × (N / G) bfloat16
```

Example packing for 8 consecutive 4-bit values `[a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h]`:

```plain
uint32_value = (h << 28) | (g << 24) | (f << 20) | (e << 16) |
               (d << 12) | (c << 8)  | (b << 4)  | a

Unpacking:
  a = (uint32_value >> 0)  & 0xF
  b = (uint32_value >> 4)  & 0xF
  c = (uint32_value >> 8)  & 0xF
  ...
  h = (uint32_value >> 28) & 0xF
```

## Revisit the Decode Roofline

The packed codes are not the entire W4 representation. Each group of 128
weights also stores one BF16 scale and one BF16 bias:

```plain
bytes per W4 weight = 0.5 + (2 + 2) / 128 = 0.53125 bytes
streamed W4 bytes   = 4,022,272,000 × 0.53125 = 2.137 GB per token
arithmetic intensity = 8.045 GFLOPs / 2.137 GB = 3.765 FLOPs/byte
```

Now W4 can be added to the dense comparison:

| Weight format | Value bits | Metadata per 128 weights | Effective bytes per weight | Streamed weight bytes per token | Weight arithmetic intensity |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|
| FP16 | 16 | None | 2 | 8.045 GB | 1.0 FLOP/byte |
| BF16 | 16 | None | 2 | 8.045 GB | 1.0 FLOP/byte |
| W4 | 4 | One BF16 scale and one BF16 bias | 0.53125 | 2.137 GB | 3.765 FLOPs/byte |

This representation reduces projection weight traffic by 3.765×. Treat that
ratio as a weight-traffic advantage for one-token decode, not as an end-to-end
speedup promise.

### Theoretical Decode Roofline Across Apple Silicon

Apple publishes unified-memory bandwidth but not a directly comparable BF16
GPU TFLOPS figure. A bandwidth roofline can therefore be calculated without
assuming a compute ceiling:

```plain
ideal tokens/s = advertised memory bandwidth / streamed weight bytes per token
```

The table uses the highest-bandwidth configuration of each named chip listed
in the cited Apple product specifications. GB is decimal, matching Apple's
specifications. The results are theoretical ceilings, not benchmark
measurements.

| Chip | Bandwidth | FP16/BF16 roofline | W4 roofline |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| M1 Pro | 200 GB/s | 24.9 tok/s | 93.6 tok/s |
| M1 Max | 400 GB/s | 49.7 tok/s | 187.2 tok/s |
| M1 Ultra | 800 GB/s | 99.4 tok/s | 374.4 tok/s |
| M2 Pro | 200 GB/s | 24.9 tok/s | 93.6 tok/s |
| M2 Max | 400 GB/s | 49.7 tok/s | 187.2 tok/s |
| M2 Ultra | 800 GB/s | 99.4 tok/s | 374.4 tok/s |
| M3 Pro | 150 GB/s | 18.6 tok/s | 70.2 tok/s |
| M3 Max | 400 GB/s | 49.7 tok/s | 187.2 tok/s |
| M3 Ultra | 819 GB/s | 101.8 tok/s | 383.3 tok/s |
| M4 Pro | 273 GB/s | 33.9 tok/s | 127.8 tok/s |
| M4 Max | 546 GB/s | 67.9 tok/s | 255.5 tok/s |

The advertised bandwidths come from Apple's specifications for
[M1 Pro and Max](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/introducing-m1-pro-and-m1-max-the-most-powerful-chips-apple-has-ever-built/),
[M1 Ultra](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/03/apple-unveils-m1-ultra-the-worlds-most-powerful-chip-for-a-personal-computer/),
[M2 Pro and Max](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/01/apple-unveils-m2-pro-and-m2-max-next-generation-chips-for-next-level-workflows/),
[M2 Ultra](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/apple-introduces-m2-ultra/),
[M3 Pro and Max](https://support.apple.com/en-us/117736),
[M3 Ultra in the 2025 Mac Studio](https://support.apple.com/en-us/122211), and
[M4 Pro and Max](https://support.apple.com/en-us/121553). The 2025 Mac Studio
specifications list M3 Ultra alongside M4 Max, not an M4 Ultra; this dated
comparison stops at M4 Pro/Max and makes no claim about subsequent products.

These values assume peak advertised bandwidth, one read of every projection
weight, and no other traffic or work. A complete model also reads activations
and KV, launches other operators, and cannot sustain peak bandwidth
continuously, so actual throughput is lower. The
[performance appendix](./appendix-performance.md) records measured results
separately from this theoretical exercise.

This roofline describes one-token decode, where `M = 1` and each streamed
weight serves one activation row. Prefill reuses each weight tile across many
rows and raises arithmetic intensity, so it needs a matrix schedule. The decode
bandwidth ratio does not predict prefill performance.

## Quantized Matrix Multiplication

### Mathematical Formulation

For the matrix product `C = A B^T`, multiply `A` by the transpose of `B`.
The arrays are:

- `A`: shape `(M, N)`, bfloat16 (activations)
- `B`: shape `(K, N)`, **quantized** to int4 (weights)
- `C`: shape `(M, K)`, same 16-bit dtype as `A` (output)

Each element `C[i, k]` is computed as:

$$
C[i, k] = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} A[i, j] \times B[k, j]
$$

For output row `i` and column `k`, multiply `A[i, j]` by `B[k, j]` for
each input position `j` from zero through `N - 1`, then add the products.

With quantization, `B[k, j]` is represented as:

$$
B[k, j] = B_{\text{quantized}}[k, j] \times \text{scale}[k, g] + \text{bias}[k, g]
$$

Reconstruct `B[k, j]` by multiplying its unsigned four-bit code by the
stored scale for row `k` and group `g`, then adding that group's stored bias.

Here, `g = floor(j / G)` is the group index.

Substituting:

$$
C[i, k] = \sum_{g=0}^{N/G-1} \sum_{j'=0}^{G-1} A[i, g \times G + j'] \times (B_{\text{quantized}}[k, g \times G + j'] \times \text{scale}[k, g] + \text{bias}[k, g])
$$

For each group `g` and position `j'` within it, multiply activation
`A[i, g*G + j']` by the reconstructed weight at row `k` and that position;
sum those products over all `N/G` groups and all `G` positions per group.

Rearranging:

$$
C[i, k] = \sum_{g=0}^{N/G-1} \left( \text{scale}[k, g] \sum_{j'=0}^{G-1} A[i, g \times G + j'] \times B_{\text{quantized}}[k, g \times G + j'] + \text{bias}[k, g] \sum_{j'=0}^{G-1} A[i, g \times G + j'] \right)
$$

Equivalently, within each group, multiply the stored scale by the sum of
activation-times-code products, and add the stored bias multiplied by the sum
of those same activations. Add the group results to obtain `C[i, k]`.

The scale and bias are constant within a group, so the computation can reuse
them across all values in that group.

### Computation Flow

```plain
Input:
  A: M × N (bfloat16 activations)
  B_quantized: K × (N/8) (uint32, packed weights)
  scales: K × (N/G) (bfloat16)
  biases: K × (N/G) (bfloat16)

Output:
  C: M × K (bfloat16)

For each output element C[i, k]:
  sum = 0  # float accumulator
  for each group g in 0..(N/G - 1):
    scale = scales[k, g]
    bias = biases[k, g]

    # Process G values in the group (G/8 uint32 packs)
    for each pack p in 0..(G/8 - 1):
      packed_value = B_quantized[k, g*(G/8) + p]

      # Unpack 8 × 4-bit values
      for bit_offset in [0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28]:
        quantized = (packed_value >> bit_offset) & 0xF
        b_value = quantized * scale + bias
        a_value = A[i, g*G + p*8 + bit_offset/4]
        sum = sum + a_value * b_value

  C[i, k] = bfloat16(sum)
```

## Task 1: Implement Quantized Linear and Embedding

```
src/tiny_llm/quantize.py
src/tiny_llm/embedding.py
```

Inspect and reuse the starter's `QuantizedWeights.from_mlx_layer` packed-weight
plumbing. Modify these learner-owned functions:

- `dequantize_weights` and `quantized_linear` in
  `src/tiny_llm/quantize.py`;
- `QuantizedEmbedding.__call__` and `QuantizedEmbedding.as_linear` in
  `src/tiny_llm/embedding.py`.

`QuantizedWeights` holds a quantized matrix and its dequantization parameters:

| Field | Shape | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `weight` | `(K, N/8)` uint32 | Packed quantized weights. Each uint32 stores eight consecutive 4-bit values. |
| `scales` | `(K, N/G)` bfloat16 | Stored signed per-group scale factors for dequantization. The sign determines which endpoint maps to the low codes. |
| `biases` | `(K, N/G)` bfloat16 | Stored per-group offsets. Code 0 reconstructs to this value. |
| `group_size` | int | Number of consecutive values that share the same scale/bias. For the Qwen3 MLX 4-bit weights used here, this is `128`. |
| `bits` | int | Quantization bit width (typically 4, meaning values are in range `[0, 15]`) |

The supplied `from_mlx_layer` method extracts these fields from an MLX
quantized layer during model loading. Reuse it rather than introducing a second
loader.

Then implement `quantized_linear` as a wrapper around `quantized_matmul`, using
the same input convention as the standard `linear` function. The next task
makes `quantized_matmul` runnable.

Keep the token embedding table quantized too. Add a `QuantizedEmbedding`
wrapper with two call patterns:

- `embedding(input_ids)` performs a row lookup. Gather the matching packed
  weights, scales, and biases. Unpack each `uint32` with shifts and masks,
  repeat each group's scale and bias across its 128 values, and compute
  `q * scale + bias` with basic `mlx.core` array operations. Do not call
  `mx.dequantize`. Put this unpacking logic in `dequantize_weights(...)` so
  the embedding and its direct tests share one explicit implementation.
- `embedding.as_linear(h)` is the tied output projection. Implement this with
  `quantized_linear(h, embedding_weight)` so it uses your quantized matmul path
  instead of materializing the full `vocab_size x hidden_size` table. This path
  starts working once the quantized matmul kernel is implemented in the next
  tasks.

## Task 2: Define the Quantized Matmul Primitive

```
src/extensions/src/tiny_llm_ext.h
src/extensions/bindings.cpp
src/extensions/src/quantized_matmul.cpp
src/extensions/CMakeLists.txt
```

The declaration, fail-closed source stub, binding, and build registration are
already present. Keep the C++ declarations and definitions in the
`tiny_llm_ext` namespace, and modify these exact functions:

- **`tiny_llm_ext.h`** — Read the Week 2 Day 2 `quantized_matmul(...)`
  declaration and `QuantizedMatmul` primitive interface; keep its signature in
  sync with the binding.
- **`bindings.cpp`** — Verify the existing `m.def("quantized_matmul", ...)`
  entry; do not create a second binding.
- **`quantized_matmul.cpp`** — Replace the body of
  `tiny_llm_ext::quantized_matmul(...)` to validate
  inputs, determine the output shape, return a lazy `mx::array`, and reject CPU
  evaluation explicitly in `QuantizedMatmul::eval_cpu(...)`.
- **`CMakeLists.txt`** — Verify the existing `quantized_matmul.cpp` source
  registration; do not add a duplicate.

The extension API lets an `mx.array` graph node schedule the Metal loop from
the next task. MLX owns the array lifetime and command encoder; your primitive
supplies the quantized multiplication.

Build now to catch declaration, binding, and registration mismatches. The
focused test checks the Task 1 Python wrappers. The primitive becomes runnable
after you implement its Metal schedules in Task 3:

```bash
pdm run build-ext
pdm run test --week 2 --day 2 -- -k task_1
```

## Task 3: Implement Metal Matrix Products

Before writing the Metal kernels, connect their work to Metal's four nested
execution scopes:

- **Lane (thread).** The smallest unit. Each lane executes the same
  instruction stream with its own register file. Lanes within a SIMD group
  can share data through `simd_` operations.
- **SIMD group (warp/subgroup).** A fixed-size set of lanes (32 on Apple
  GPUs) that execute in lockstep. `simd_sum`, `simd_shuffle`, and
  `simdgroup_matrix` operations work within this scope. A SIMD group cannot
  directly share registers with another SIMD group in the same threadgroup.
- **Threadgroup (block).** A collection of SIMD groups scheduled together on
  one GPU core. Threadgroups share threadgroup memory (explicitly allocated
  with `threadgroup` address space and synchronized with
  `threadgroup_barrier`). The grid is a 1D/2D/3D array of threadgroups.
- **Grid.** The total work dispatched. `dispatchThreadgroups` launches a grid
  of threadgroups; the GPU schedules them across available cores. Increasing
  the grid's threadgroup count can expose more independent work, but a finer
  partition can also duplicate reads or require partial-result merging.

Keep two launch knobs separate. Adding SIMD groups within one threadgroup adds
threads and can raise register demand; it increases threadgroup-memory use only
when the schedule allocates shared storage per group or tile. Either resource
can reduce the number of resident threadgroups. Adding threadgroups to the grid
changes how output or reduction work is partitioned. Measure both choices;
neither guarantees higher throughput.

Begin with the required two-SIMD-group matvec schedule for Qwen. Then benchmark
two, four, eight, and sixteen groups per threadgroup as described below. Change
the grid partition separately so each measurement isolates one launch knob.

```
src/extensions/src/quantized_matmul.metal
src/extensions/src/quantized_matmul.cpp
```

Modify these exact starter functions:

- `QuantizedMatmul::eval_gpu` in `quantized_matmul.cpp`;
- `quantized_matmul_vanilla_w4a16_g128` and
  `quantized_matvec_x4_fast_w4a16_g128` in `quantized_matmul.metal`;
- `quantized_matmul_vanilla` and `quantized_matvec_custom` in
  `src/tiny_llm/quantize.py` for the explicit comparison paths.

Write both Metal kernels, then connect `eval_gpu` to them. On GPU, the Python
`quantized_matmul` wrapper always dispatches your primitive. The required path
never routes through `mx.quantized_matmul`.

Work in two measured stages. Both implement the same math, with schedules for
different shapes:

1. **Vanilla matmul:** one Metal thread computes one output element. This is
   the direct GPU translation of the computation flow above and an inspectable
   bring-up control.
2. **SIMD matvec:** for decode, SIMD lanes cooperate on the reduction for one
   activation row and calculate several output columns together.

Here, `M` is the number of activation rows after flattening every leading
dimension. Day 2 uses this explicit dispatch:

| Activation rows | Kernel | Role at this checkpoint |
|---:|---|---|
| `M <= 8` | SIMD matvec | Optimized path for decode and other very small matrix inputs. |
| `M > 8` | Vanilla matmul | Correctness-first prefill path; Day 3 replaces it with a cooperative tiled kernel. |

The cutoff does not extend the SIMD kernel to larger `M`. These are separate
schedules: Day 2 optimizes vector-shaped decode and leaves matrix-shaped
prefill visible for the later benchmark to select.

Keep the vanilla function callable as `quantized_matmul_vanilla` so every
optimization can be compared directly with its readable control.

### Stage 1: Vanilla Matmul

Start with a two-dimensional grid over output row `i` and output column `k`.
Each thread walks all `N` input values, unpacks eight int4 weights from each
`uint32`, applies the group scale and bias, and accumulates one `C[i, k]` in
float32. This kernel repeats activation loads and does not share work, but its
control flow mirrors the equation and makes it a useful debugging control. The
Python `mlx.core` equation remains the correctness oracle for both Metal
schedules.

Keep the vanilla kernel for matrix-shaped prefill in this chapter; Day 3
revisits that workload with cooperative tiling.

### Stage 2: SIMD Matvec

Decode normally has `M = 1`, so an 8×8 matrix tile would leave most rows empty.
Instead, let one SIMD group reduce the input dimension and use `simd_sum` to
combine lane-local partial sums. Begin with two output columns per group as an
inspectable schedule. For the Qwen3-4B checkpoint, evaluate a four-column path
in which each lane loads two adjacent packed words, or 16 activations, and
reuses them across the four outputs.

The optimized path also uses this affine identity to avoid applying the bias
separately to every unpacked value:

$$
\sum_j a_j(sq_j+b) = s\sum_j a_jq_j + b\sum_j a_j
$$

The left side sums activation `a_j` times its reconstructed weight
`s*q_j + b`. The right side computes the same sum by multiplying `s` by the
activation-times-code sum, then adding `b` times the activation sum.

The kernel also scales the activations once and reads four packed int4 values
through a 16-bit mask,
avoiding a shift for every weight and output row. This adds live accumulators,
so test it as a complete schedule rather than assuming fewer integer
instructions must be faster.

### Tune the SIMD Schedule

Treat output width, threadgroup size, and shared-memory reuse as benchmark
variables. Begin with this Qwen-focused configuration:

- flatten all leading activation dimensions into `M`,
- use the custom matvec when `M <= 8` and the vanilla matmul when `M > 8`,
- compute four output columns per SIMD group and load two adjacent packed words
  per lane,
- launch two SIMD groups, or eight output rows, per threadgroup.

These thresholds are measured starting points rather than mathematical
requirements. Keep them visible in the dispatcher and vary one choice at a
time. Compare two, four, and eight output columns per SIMD group. More columns
increase activation reuse, but also extend accumulator lifetimes and raise
register pressure. Compare two, four, eight, and sixteen SIMD groups per
threadgroup. More groups expose additional outputs, but may duplicate
activation reads and reduce residency.

Evaluate the affine rearrangement as part of the complete schedule. A lower
instruction count helps only if the longer-lived activation sum and output
accumulators do not reduce occupancy. Select the schedule with a synchronized
whole-model decode benchmark, not with an instruction-count estimate.

Define a row-contiguous Python-to-extension contract for scales, biases,
activations, and packed weights. Call `mx.contiguous` once at that boundary and
validate the layout in the C++ primitive before encoding the kernel. Metal
receives raw buffers rather than implicit array strides, so layout is a
correctness condition as well as a performance condition.

Read activations directly in the kernel. The one-row activation is small and
cache-friendly, while staging it in threadgroup memory adds a barrier to every
projection. If you test shared staging as an ablation, keep it only when the
whole-model result shows that reuse outweighs synchronization.

### Kernel Requirements

Implement both required layouts in `quantized_matmul.metal`:

- First, implement the vanilla one-thread-per-output matrix grid.
- For `M <= 8`, assign one SIMD group to an output tile. Cooperatively reduce
  the input dimension and compute several output columns per group.
- For `M > 8`, dispatch the vanilla matrix grid. Do not loop over rows with the
  SIMD matvec schedule; Day 3 introduces the tiled prefill schedule.
- The required kernel supports `bfloat16_t` inputs and outputs. The Week 2
  checkpoint does not add a second model-storage dtype.
- Apply the group-wise dequantization loop defined earlier in this chapter:
  - Iterate over groups of 128 values.
  - Unpack int4 values from each `uint32`.
  - Dequantize each value with `q * scale + bias`.
  - Accumulate products in `float`, then cast the result to the kernel dtype.
- Add boundary checks (`i < M`, `k < K`) before writing output.

The custom kernel only needs to support `bits = 4` and `group_size = 128`. Use
the group size to compute `groups_per_row` and the packed-weight offsets.
Instantiate the required Metal kernel for `bfloat16_t` and select it in
`eval_gpu`. If you retain an optional `half` specialization, keep it out of the
model dispatch in your solution.

### GPU Dispatch

Complete `eval_gpu` in `quantized_matmul.cpp` with `axpby`'s GPU dispatch
pattern:

1. Get the Metal device and command encoder from the stream.
2. Load the quantized matmul kernel matching the output dtype from the Metal
   library.
3. Bind the input and output buffers and the dimension constants (`M`, `N`,
   `K`). The buffer order must match the kernel signature.
4. Select the matrix-vector layout for `M <= 8`; otherwise select the vanilla
   matrix layout. Keep both paths explicit for direct comparisons.
   Calculate a SIMD-aligned thread-group configuration and tile output columns
   so packed input values and activations can be reused. Use the four-column,
   two-packed-word kernel with two SIMD groups.
5. Dispatch with `dispatchThreadgroups`.

Run the focused GPU gate:

```bash
pdm run build-ext
pdm run build-ext-ref
pdm run test --week 2 --day 2 -- -k gpu
```

The direct tests cover matvec at `M = 1` and `M = 8`, the vanilla matmul at
`M = 128`, and compare them with an MLX oracle. The oracle checks the result;
it is not the implementation under test.

## Task 4: Integrate Before Continuing

```
src/tiny_llm/qwen3_week2.py
```

Modify `Qwen3ModelWeek2.__init__`, `Qwen3MultiHeadAttention.__call__`,
`Qwen3MLP.__call__`, and `Qwen3ModelWeek2.__call__`. These are the points that
load quantized weights, replace dense projections, and keep only the requested
logits row.

Now integrate quantized matrix multiplication into the Week 2 Qwen3 model so
its linear layers remain quantized throughout inference.

Change the weight type from `mx.array` to `QuantizedWeights` for every
attention projection (`wq`, `wk`, `wv`, and `wo`) and MLP projection (`w_gate`,
`w_up`, and `w_down`). Replace `linear(x, w)` with `quantized_linear(x, w)`. In
the Week 2 model loader, use `QuantizedWeights.from_mlx_layer(...)` instead of
materializing a 16-bit matrix. Keep the Week 1 model's boundary intact; its
layers still expect plain `mx.array` weights.

For embeddings, wire the `QuantizedEmbedding` from Task 1 into the loader. Load
`embed_tokens` with `QuantizedWeights.from_mlx_layer(...)` and pass it to
`QuantizedEmbedding`. If the model has a separate `lm_head`, keep that head as
`QuantizedWeights` too and apply it with `quantized_linear`; `lm_head` is a
projection rather than an embedding lookup.

Normalize each loaded layer's scales and biases to BF16. Require scales,
biases, and activations to match and return BF16. If the output is `nan` or
otherwise invalid, check for a dtype mismatch first.

Preserve the quantized layer's parameters as well. The model should pass
`w.group_size` and `w.bits` to the extension, which should validate the course
assumptions: `group_size = 128` and `bits = 4`.

Run the complete gate, then the live model checkpoint:

```bash
pdm run test --week 2 --day 2

pdm run main --solution tiny_llm --loader week2 \
  --week2-checkpoint quantized-matvec --model qwen3-0.6b --max-tokens 16
```

Measure that same learner solution with the cached 0.6B model. Keep the model,
prompt/output lengths, and last-logit serving mode matched when changing the
solution or checkpoint:

```bash
pdm run bench --solution tiny_llm --loader week2 \
  --week2-checkpoint quantized-matvec --model qwen3-0.6b \
  --num-seqs 1 --min-input-len 128 --max-input-len 128 \
  --min-output-len 65 --max-output-len 65 --warmup 2 \
  --prefill-logits last
```

Run the same command with `--solution tiny_llm_ref` to compare it with the
reference solution. For a Day 1 control, change only the checkpoint to
`capacity-cache`; do not compare different models or prefill-logit modes.

Keep the vanilla matrix product callable as an inspectable Metal control. The
Python `mlx.core` equation remains the correctness oracle, while decode
integrates only the SIMD matvec.

## Verify Quantization in the Complete Model

Before moving on, confirm that model inference actually calls the quantized
matvec kernel instead of merely registering and testing it in isolation.

The checkpoint is complete when the model's projection dispatcher is wired to
your custom primitive. Decode-shaped work must route through
`quantized_linear` → `quantized_matvec_custom` → the extension primitive → the
Metal matvec. Matrix-shaped work must route through `quantized_linear` →
`quantized_matmul` → the extension primitive → its Metal matrix schedule. The
supplied tests compare public `quantized-matvec` checkpoint outputs and direct
operator results with MLX controls; they do not assert private routing. Use
the live model command to verify that those pieces compose.

Measure the cumulative model and the real projection shapes:

```bash
pdm run bench-week2-progression --offline --solution tiny_llm --suite week2 --repeats 2 \
  --variant week2-capacity-cache --variant week2-quantized-matvec --variant mlx \
  --model qwen3-0.6b --input-len 128 --output-len 129 --warmup 2 \
  --prefill-logits last

pdm run profile-week2-kernels --solution tiny_llm --model qwen3-0.6b \
  --case capacity-cache:decode:128 --case quantized-matvec:decode:128 \
  --warmup 4 --iterations 12 \
  --json-output week2-day2-attribution.json
```

Keep one cumulative model row and one representative real-shape projection
comparison. In the checked M4 Pro example, packed W4 reduced attributed
projection time by 69.0% and fixed-workload decode rose from 24.38 to 58.90
tokens/s. The re-profile then exposed normalization, position, and activation
at 33.5% of attributed time, pointing to later fusion work. These are
historical Qwen3-4B observations from one machine and two product samples,
not results to expect from the required 0.6B run or portable timing thresholds.
For an optional 4B comparison, first cache the model with
`hf download Qwen/Qwen3-4B-MLX-4bit`, then rerun every compared row with
`--model qwen3-4b`; the dense `capacity-cache` control needs the memory
recommended in the [model table](./preface.md#choose-a-model-for-your-mac).
The complete historical campaign and attribution are in the
[performance appendix](./appendix-performance.md).

If you need to continue without the custom Day 2 kernels, implement the same
`quantized_linear` interface with `mx.quantized_matmul` and leave the rest of
the course model unchanged. This is a local operator off-ramp, not
`--solution mlx`: the latter runs a separate complete model and does not
exercise your cache or model wiring.
