# 🚧 Week 3 Day 1: Continuous Batching

You begin with the completed Week 2 single-request model: multi-offset RoPE and
causal masking already have stable interfaces, and each request can own a dense
KV cache. The Day 1 starter leaves four learner-owned slices behind those
interfaces:

- dense batch assembly and masking in `BatchingKvCache`;
- `mlx_quantized_linear` plus the per-weight selector and the explicit
  `dispatch_week3_batch_model` factory;
- selector propagation through `Qwen3ModelWeek2`; and
- `Request.try_prefill` plus the request-admission/decode loop in
  `batch_generate`.

Complete and test those slices in order. The resulting **continuous batch**
keeps several active requests on the device and replaces each request as soon
as it finishes. Only quantized projections cross the Week 3 MLX seam;
normalization, activation, RoPE, cache state, attention, and scheduling remain
course-owned.

So far, each generation loop has processed only one request. That may not
provide enough work to use the device efficiently, so Day 1 decodes several
requests in each model call.

A static batch could select five prompts and run them together until every
request finishes. However, generated sequences have different lengths. If four
requests finish quickly while the fifth continues, most of the batch remains
idle and queued requests cannot start.

Continuous batching instead sets a maximum number of active decode requests.
When one finishes, the scheduler assigns its batch slot and KV-cache entry to a
waiting request. This keeps the decode batch populated whenever work is queued.

The scheduler must also interleave prefill and decode work. We will use a simple
policy: advance one pending prefill, then decode one token for every active
request.

```python
while requests_in_queue_or_in_progress:
    if prefill_request is not None:
        prefill_request.try_prefill()  # Day 1 processes the complete prompt
        if prefill_request.ready:
            if kv_cache.try_add(prefill_request):
                prefill_request = next(requests)
    if active_requests:
        tokens = decode(model, kv_cache)
        for request, token in zip(active_requests, tokens):
            request.append(token)
```

A complete prompt is admitted in one call on Day 1. This makes the scheduling
policy easy to inspect and exposes an important limitation: one long prefill
can delay every active request's next decode step. Day 2 will add a bounded
prefill budget to solve that fairness problem.

## Task 1: Reuse RoPE and Causal Masking for Batched Requests

```
src/tiny_llm/week2_kernels.py::FastRoPE  (reuse unchanged)
src/tiny_llm/attention.py::causal_mask   (reuse unchanged)
```

Continuous batching requires one RoPE offset per batch element and a causal
mask whose query and source lengths may differ. Verify those two Week 2
interfaces before adding the scheduler so the serving layer can use one model
contract for every request position.

Verify multi-offset RoPE and the rectangular causal mask with:

```bash
pdm run test --week 3 --day 1 -- -k task_1
```

## Task 2: Batch KV Cache

```
src/tiny_llm/kv_cache.py::BatchingKvCache
```

`BatchingKvCache` holds one request cache per decode slot. Because requests may
have different sequence lengths, it must combine their keys and values into
dense tensors and construct a matching `B x 1 x L x S` mask.

```
S = max(S_i across active requests)
L = mask_length (input parameter)
request_keys: H, S_i, D
request_values: H, S_i, D
batched_keys: B, H, S, D
batched_values: B, H, S, D
mask: B, 1, L, S
```

Right-align each active request in the common `S` dimension. The leading
positions remain zero and masked out. Inactive slots remain fully masked.

```python
keys_i, values_i = request_cache[i]
batched_keys[i, :, (S - S_i):S, :] = keys_i
batched_values[i, :, (S - S_i):S, :] = values_i
mask[i, :, 0:L, (S - S_i):S] = causal_mask(L, S_i)
```

You can verify your solution by running:

```bash
pdm run test --week 3 --day 1 -- -k task_2
```

## Task 3: Add the Week 3 Projection Seam

```
src/tiny_llm/quantize.py::mlx_quantized_linear
src/tiny_llm/qwen3_week2.py::Qwen3ModelWeek2.__init__
src/tiny_llm/models.py::dispatch_week3_batch_model
```

Week 2 ends with a course-owned quantized matmul so you can inspect its loader,
SIMD-matrix operations, and Split-K policy. Week 3 teaches serving mechanisms,
so it should not make every cache and scheduler measurement depend on that
teaching kernel's remaining projection overhead.

Add a per-weight `use_mlx_quantized_linear` selector whose default remains
`False`, preserving every Week 2 checkpoint. When selected,
`quantized_linear` should call `mx.quantized_matmul` with the same packed
weight, scales, biases, group size, bits, and transposed-weight convention.
Then implement `dispatch_week3_batch_model` as the explicit construction seam:
it builds the completed dense-cache Week 2 model with that selector enabled.

Call this batch-ready model with several requests, one offset per batch
element, and the mask returned by `BatchingKvCache`. Exercise requests joining
and leaving at different positions. Only quantized projections cross the MLX
seam; normalization, RoPE, activation, attention, cache state, and scheduling
remain in your solution. The model remains request-agnostic; slot ownership and
lifecycle belong to the cache and scheduler.

Verify the projection seam and its batch-model factory with:

```bash
pdm run test --week 3 --day 1 -- -k task_3
```

## Task 4: Batch Generate

```
src/tiny_llm/batch.py
```

First implement `Request.try_prefill` by prefilling the complete prompt in one
call. The visible `prefill_max_step` input is reserved for Day 2; on Day 1, give
this call a budget that covers the complete remaining prompt. Then complete the
scheduler in `batch_generate`: move finished prefills into idle decode slots,
collect the next token and offset for each slot, and remove requests that reach
EOS or `max_seq_len`. A prompt longer than `max_seq_len` must fail before model
or cache work, and a generated token that would cross the limit is not emitted.

Results are returned in **completion order**, because short requests can leave
the batch before earlier long requests. Each result's `prompt_idx` maps it back
to the original input position; do not reorder completed results into input
order.

Use the supplied scheduler checkpoint for full prefill, admission and slot
reuse, immediate EOS, maximum-length termination, completion-order results,
and their original `prompt_idx` values:

```bash
pdm run test --week 3 --day 1 -- -k task_4
```

Then run the complete scheduler against the real model:

```bash
pdm run batch-main --solution tiny_llm --loader week2
```

By default, `batch-main` uses Qwen3-0.6B with a batch size of five and a fixed
prompt set. Treat it as a product smoke: watch requests enter, decode, finish,
and release their slots. Its shuffled prompt order and cumulative wall-clock
display are not the source of a decode-gap measurement.

Day 2's deterministic `bench-chunked-prefill` runner owns that comparison. Its
512-token budget processes every prompt in the checked 64–512-token trace in
one chunk, so that row is the reproducible Day 1 control. The runner records
the exact token ids, output budget, seed, process order, and decode-completion
gaps before Day 2 changes the prefill budget.
