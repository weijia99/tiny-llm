# Week 1 Day 5: The Qwen3 Model

On Day 5, we will combine the components from the previous chapters into the complete Qwen3 model.

Model-level tests require the corresponding model files. Start with the default 0.6B model; download the larger models
only if you want to test them as well:

```bash
hf download Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B-MLX-4bit
# Optional larger models:
hf download Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B-MLX-4bit
hf download Qwen/Qwen3-4B-MLX-4bit
```

The deterministic checkpoint tests do not need downloaded model files. The default 0.6B model is required for the final
Day 5 integration check; only checks for the optional larger models are skipped when those files are unavailable. A skip
means that the model-backed check did not run, not that it passed.

## Task 1: Implement `Qwen3TransformerBlock`

```
src/tiny_llm/qwen3_week1.py
```

Qwen3 uses the following Transformer block structure:

```
  input
/ |
| input_layernorm (RMSNorm)
| |
| Qwen3MultiHeadAttention
\ |
  Add (residual)
/ |
| post_attention_layernorm (RMSNorm)
| |
| MLP
\ |
  Add (residual)
  |
output
```

Read `head_dim` independently from the model configuration rather than deriving it from `hidden_size` and the number of
attention heads. Match the reference block's output dtype.

Run the tests for this task with:

```bash
pdm run test --week 1 --day 5 -- -k task_1
```

## Task 2: Implement `Embedding`

```
src/tiny_llm/embedding.py
```

**📚 Readings**

- [LLM Embeddings Explained: A Visual and Intuitive Guide](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hesamation/primer-llm-embedding)

The embedding layer maps token IDs (integers) to vectors of length `embedding_dim`. In this task, you will implement
that lookup operation.

```
Embedding::__call__
weight: vocab_size x embedding_dim
Input: N.. (tokens)
Output: N.. x embedding_dim (vectors)
```

This can be implemented with array indexing.

Token IDs may have any number of leading dimensions. The lookup appends `embedding_dim` to that shape and preserves the
BF16 model-facing dtype.

When input and output embeddings are tied, Qwen3 also uses the embedding weight as a linear projection from hidden vectors
back to vocabulary logits.

```
Embedding::as_linear
weight: vocab_size x embedding_dim
Input: N.. x embedding_dim
Output: N.. x vocab_size
```

The projection accepts the same arbitrary leading dimensions, replacing only the final `embedding_dim` axis with
`vocab_size` and preserving BF16.

Run the tests for this task with:

```bash
# Deterministic lookup and projection checks always run. The downloaded model adds integration parity.
pdm run test --week 1 --day 5 -- -k task_2
```

## Task 3: Implement `Qwen3ModelWeek1`

Now that we have built all the Qwen3 components, we can implement `Qwen3ModelWeek1`.

```
src/tiny_llm/qwen3_week1.py
```

You will not implement the process of reading model parameters from tensor files. Instead, load the model with `mlx_lm`,
then transfer its parameters into our implementation. The `Qwen3ModelWeek1` constructor therefore accepts an MLX model.

The Qwen3 model has the following layers:

```
input
| (tokens: N..)
Embedding
| (N.. x hidden_size); note that hidden_size == embedding_dim
Qwen3TransformerBlock
| (N.. x hidden_size)
Qwen3TransformerBlock
| (N.. x hidden_size)
...
|
RMSNorm 
| (N.. x hidden_size)
Embedding.as_linear OR linear (lm_head)
| (N.. x vocab_size)
output
```

Read the number of layers, hidden size, head dimension, and other configuration values from `mlx_model.args`, whose type
is defined by [`ModelArgs`](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm/blob/main/mlx_lm/models/qwen3.py). The loaded weights
are available through `mlx_model.model`; use the Qwen3 implementation and model metadata to identify the corresponding
layer names.

Instantiate every configured Transformer block in model order, run all of them, and apply the final RMSNorm before the
vocabulary projection. `head_dim`, the query and key/value head counts, intermediate size, RMS epsilon, maximum positions,
and RoPE theta are separate configuration fields; map each one directly.

By this point, you have implemented `RMSNorm`. Replace the temporary Day 3 calls to `mx.fast.rms_norm` with
`RMSNorm(head_dim, q_norm, eps=...)` and `RMSNorm(head_dim, k_norm, eps=...)`. They implement the same formula; the built-in
calls existed only to keep the GQA chapter focused on attention.

Different Qwen3 model variants map hidden vectors back to vocabulary logits in different ways. Some tie the input and
output embeddings and use `Embedding.as_linear`; others have a separate `lm_head` linear layer. Select the strategy with
`mlx_model.args.tie_word_embeddings`: if it is `True`, use `Embedding.as_linear`; otherwise, load and use `lm_head`.

The model takes a sequence of token IDs and returns unnormalized logits for every sequence position. On Day 6, we will
use the final position's logits to select the next token and generate a response.

The MLX models used in this course have quantized weights. Dequantize each
linear or embedding layer before loading it into tiny-llm by using the provided
`quantize.dequantize_linear` function, then store the readable Week 1 weight as
BF16. Model activations and layer outputs should remain BF16. A readable
attention or normalization expression may compute in FP32 for stability, but it
must cast its model-facing result back to BF16.

Pass `mask="causal"` to every Transformer block. For a one-token sequence the mask has no effect; for longer sequences,
it prevents each position from attending to future tokens.

Run the tests for this task with:

```bash
# The required 0.6B integration check exercises Task 3; download it if it is not already cached.
hf download Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B-MLX-4bit
pdm run test --week 1 --day 5 -- -k task_3
```

You may also download the optional 1.7B and 4B models from the commands at the top of this chapter. Their checks skip when
the corresponding files are absent.

At the end of the day, you should be able to pass all tests of this day:

```bash
pdm run test --week 1 --day 5
```

Before treating this as a pass, confirm that the deterministic Task 2 checks ran and that the required 0.6B Task 3
integration check passed rather than skipped.
