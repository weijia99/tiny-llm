# 🚧 Week 3 Day 4: Direct Paged Attention

> 🚧 This chapter is under review and may change.

In this chapter, you will make **direct paged attention** handle decode and
prefill in both float32 and BF16. The scheduler passes request-local block
tables and context lengths to the operator, which reads K/V from the shared
layer pool without gathering a dense batch first. One correct page-walking
kernel may serve every query shape; separate decode and prefill kernels are an
optimization choice. Day 5 replaces the supported BF16 long-prefill hot case
with a tiled implementation.

> **Prerequisite:** Complete Week 3 Day 3's paged storage and Week 2 Day 5's
> online-softmax attention. The new concept here is translating logical K/V
> positions through a block table. Tiled FlashAttention comes only after this
> direct path works.

## Paged KV Cache vs Paged Attention

These two ideas are related, but they are not the same:

1. **Paged KV cache**
   KV is stored in fixed-size pages.
2. **Paged attention**
   The attention path reads KV directly from those pages via metadata such as a page table.

You can implement the first one without the second one, but the real serving payoff comes when both are present.

## The Metadata a Paged Runtime Needs

Once KV is paged, dense `B x H x S x D` tensors are no longer the natural runtime representation. Instead, the runtime should prepare metadata like:

```plain
block_table:  [B, max_pages_per_request]
context_lens: [B]
```

For the current layer being executed:

- `block_table[b, i]` gives the page id for request `b`'s current-layer logical page `i`
- `context_lens[b]` gives the valid token count for request `b`

This is the bridge between the scheduler and the attention kernel.

A production runtime often also carries write-side metadata such as `slot_mapping`.
For this chapter, we keep the write side inside the cache and focus on the read-side
metadata needed by attention.

## Why `block_table` Matters

Suppose one layer cache for request A has:

```plain
page_ids = [12, 5, 3]
context_len = 10
page_size = 4
```

Then the logical sequence positions map to physical storage like this:

```plain
logical 0..3  -> page 12
logical 4..7  -> page 5
logical 8..9  -> page 3
```

The attention runtime does not need a fully gathered dense tensor if it already knows:

- which current-layer page each logical block lives in,
- how long the context is,
- and where the current query positions are.

That is exactly what `block_table` and `context_lens` encode.

## The Paged Attention API

At this point, the runtime should grow a new attention entry point:

```python
paged_attention(
    query,
    key_pages,
    value_pages,
    block_table,
    context_lens,
    page_size,
    scale=None,
    mask="causal",
)
```

With shapes like:

```plain
query:          B, H_q, L, D
key_pages[i]:   1, H_kv, page_size, D
value_pages[i]: 1, H_kv, page_size, D
block_table:    B, max_pages
context_lens:   B
```

The source length is no longer represented by one contiguous tensor dimension.
The operator reconstructs it logically from the page table.

In this chapter, `paged_attention` should read pages directly from a GPU
kernel. The runtime contract is now: model code and batching code pass pages
plus metadata, and the attention kernel walks that metadata without first
rebuilding dense K/V.

## Prefill Metadata

During prefill, a chunk may span multiple pages. The runtime needs to know:

- which current-layer pages already existed,
- which new pages were allocated,
- how many valid tokens are in the tail page,
- how to map incoming K/V rows into page storage.

In this teaching implementation, the cache still owns the write-side bookkeeping.
The attention path only needs the block table after the write is done.

## Decode Metadata

During decode, each active request typically writes one token.

The runtime should be able to:

1. append the token's K/V to the current tail page,
2. allocate a new page only if the tail page is full,
3. update the current layer cache's `context_len`,
4. run attention over the full logical context using `block_table`

This is the point where decode stops paying the repeated dense-repack cost from Day 1.

## Establish the Direct Page-Walking Boundary

First make every supported query shape correct through the same direct paged
boundary. You may reuse one kernel for decode and prefill. If you split the
workloads, a single tile shape is unlikely to keep the GPU busy for both a
one-token query and a long prompt. Use these design rules:

1. Preserve the Week 2 BF16 model boundary and reuse its internal accumulation
   policy unchanged.
2. For short queries, expose parallelism across the cached context. Do not
   reserve most of a threadgroup for query rows that do not exist.
3. For prefill, begin with a direct page-walking schedule whose address
   calculation is easy to validate.
4. Use the readable equation written with `mlx.core` and the dense Week 2
   attention kernel in your solution as correctness oracles for the new
   page-walking schedule.

The reference solution uses this optional split. Treat its threshold as a
value to verify on your hardware, not part of the public checkpoint:

| Shape | Dispatch in your solution | Work decomposition |
|---|---|---|
| `L <= 8` | Vector paged decode | One threadgroup per query row; 32 SIMD groups stride over the context and merge partial `(max, sum, output)` states. |
| `L > 8` | Scalar direct paged prefill | Walk logical K/V tiles through the block table and keep the schedule deliberately inspectable. Day 5 optimizes the supported BF16 hot case. |

If you make a shape decision, put it at the extension boundary rather than
converting inputs or falling back to dense attention in Python. Keep the
model-facing `paged_attention` API unchanged. Public Day 4 tests grade only its
shape, dtype, validation, page addressing, masking, and numerical behavior;
they do not require this split or any kernel name.

## How This Maps to `tiny-llm`

### `src/tiny_llm/attention.py`

Add a new function:

```python
def paged_attention(...):
    ...
```

In your solution, make it a correctness-first page-walking Metal operation
with online softmax. It may use one kernel or several internal schedules:

1. use `block_table[b]` to find the physical pages for request `b`,
2. use `context_lens[b]` to ignore unused tail capacity,
3. visit K/V in small tiles instead of materializing dense K/V,
4. merge each tile into the output with online softmax.

The important change from dense attention is the K/V address calculation. Dense attention can
advance through dense K/V by pointer arithmetic. Week 3 must translate each
logical key position through `block_table` first:

```plain
logical key position -> logical page -> physical page id -> slot in page
```

After that lookup, the online-softmax update is the same recurrence as Week 2
Day 5. Keep the page-walking schedule simple enough that block-table and
tail-page boundary errors are visible. Day 5 will tile its inner matrix work
while preserving this address calculation.

For performance, one-token decode benefits from a different work decomposition.
A 64-row prefill tile would leave almost every query row idle, so the reference
dispatches short queries to a vector-oriented kernel that partitions the
context across SIMD groups and merges their partial online-softmax states. This
split is an optimization, not a public correctness requirement.

The page pool should therefore expose contiguous physical storage:

```plain
key_pages:   P, H_kv, page_size, D
value_pages: P, H_kv, page_size, D
```

A Python list of page tensors is convenient for teaching the allocator, but a
GPU kernel needs a single buffer so `page_id` can be turned into an address.

### `src/tiny_llm/qwen3_week3.py`

The attention module should call the paged runtime directly:

```python
metadata = cache.update_and_fetch_paged(...)
x = paged_attention(...)
```

Week 3 cache handles are expected to provide paged metadata. If a dense cache is
passed to the Week 3 model, that is a programming error rather than a signal to
silently fall back to dense attention.

### `src/tiny_llm/batch.py`

The scheduler now needs to prepare runtime metadata instead of only dense K/V:

- per-layer page tables for each active request
- padded batch `block_table`
- `context_lens`

This is where continuous batching and paged attention finally connect. On Day 1, batching worked by repacking tensors. Here, batching should work by reusing page tables and updating only the new slots.

## Implementation Order

Use this implementation order:

1. paged storage
2. `block_table` / `context_lens` plumbing
3. correctness-first page-walking GPU attention
4. model and batch dispatch

Each step has a direct correctness check before the next abstraction is added.

## What Must Hold, and What Breaks If It Doesn't

These are the invariants worth checking in tests:

1. **`context_len` equals the number of written logical token positions.** If it
   is too small, attention skips written K/V; if it is too large, attention
   reads unwritten tail slots. Either case makes paged output diverge from the
   dense baseline.
2. **`block_table` reconstructs the same logical K/V order as the dense
   baseline.** A wrong mapping can pair a query with the wrong token's K/V and
   change the output even when every page contains valid data. Reordering
   complete pages can change a causal-prefix result because it changes which
   K/V pairs each query can see. By contrast, one-token decode over all
   positions in complete pages is permutation-invariant to their order when
   each K/V pair moves together.
3. **The allocator gives each page to only one live cache handle unless sharing
   is explicit.** If two live handles alias a page, a write for one request
   overwrites K/V that the other request can still attend to.
4. **Releasing a request returns every page owned by every layer cache exactly
   once.** Missing a page leaks pool capacity; returning one twice raises the
   pool's already-free error instead of completing cleanup.
5. **Decode allocates a new page only when the tail page overflows.** Allocating
   earlier strands writable tail slots and inflates the used-page count. This
   course pool grows instead of reporting exhaustion, so that waste can force
   backing storage to grow and copy earlier, increasing memory pressure.

## Task 1: Add Batch Metadata

```
src/tiny_llm/paged_kv_cache.py
src/tiny_llm/kv_cache.py
src/tiny_llm/batch.py
```

Modify `TinyKvPagedCache.block_table`, `context_lens`, `paged_metadata`, and
`update_and_fetch_paged` in `src/tiny_llm/paged_kv_cache.py`. Then update
`Request.try_prefill` and `_step` in `src/tiny_llm/batch.py` to carry those
arrays for every active request.

Extend the batch cache and scheduler so they can prepare:

- `block_table`
- `context_lens`

for all active requests.

## Task 2: Define `paged_attention`

```
src/tiny_llm/attention.py
src/extensions/src/paged_attention.cpp
src/extensions/src/paged_attention.metal
```

Modify the stable starter boundary:

- `paged_attention` in `src/tiny_llm/attention.py`;
- `tiny_llm_ext::paged_attention`, `PagedAttention::eval_cpu`, and
  `PagedAttention::eval_gpu` in `src/extensions/src/paged_attention.cpp`;
- one or more kernels in `src/extensions/src/paged_attention.metal` that
  implement the same public behavior. The starter names
  `paged_attention_decode` and `paged_attention_scalar_f32` mirror the
  reference design, but they are not required by the tests.

This checkpoint also turns the already-readable quantized token lookup into
the Week 3 one-dispatch path. Modify `QuantizedEmbedding.__call__` in
`src/tiny_llm/embedding.py`, `tiny_llm_ext::quantized_embedding` plus
`QuantizedEmbedding::eval_cpu`/`eval_gpu` in
`src/extensions/src/quantized_matmul.cpp`, and
`quantized_embedding_w4a16_g128` in
`src/extensions/src/quantized_matmul.metal`. The starter declarations,
bindings, stubs, and build registrations for both operations already exist and
remain fail-closed until you replace them.

Add a paged attention interface whose inputs come from the paged runtime rather
than a dense reconstructed `S` dimension. Preserve the Week 2 precision
contract without adding a new model dtype or conversion at the serving layer.

Walk every request's block table while keeping online-softmax state:

```python
running_max = max(previous_max, page_max)
running_sum = previous_sum * exp(previous_max - running_max) + page_sum
output = previous_output * exp(previous_max - running_max) + page_output
```

After all visible pages are consumed, divide `output` by `running_sum`.
This is the key idea that lets the kernel avoid materializing dense K/V while
still producing the same result as dense attention.

The reference solution implements two correctness-first GPU dispatches:

1. For `L <= 8`, partition logical context positions across SIMD groups and
   merge their partial `(max, sum, output)` states in threadgroup memory. The
   initial schedule uses 32 SIMD groups per query. Resolve the physical page
   once, then let group `g` visit slots `g`, `g + 32`, `g + 64`, and so on
   within that page; do not divide and reload `block_table` for every token.
2. For longer queries, it assigns query rows to a direct page-walking schedule
   and resolves every K/V tile through `block_table`. When a tile is aligned and
   cannot cross a page boundary, share its one physical page id across the
   whole tile. Its direct schedule handles both float32 and BF16, using float
   accumulators for BF16's dot products, online-softmax state, and output
   accumulation.

You may instead reuse one correct direct kernel for every query length. Favor
inspectable page ownership over the final tiled performance schedule; Day 5 is
where the supported BF16 long-prefill region receives a dedicated performance
implementation.

Compare small deterministic fixtures with the readable equation written with
`mlx.core` and the dense Week 2 attention path before tuning the page-walking
schedule.

Rebuild the extension, then use the BF16 long-prefill checkpoint as the first
feedback loop for this task:

```bash
pdm run build-ext
pdm run test --week 3 --day 4 -- -k task_2_bfloat16_long_prefill
```

The focused checkpoint constructs valid page metadata directly. It checks a
nine-token prefill and a longer multi-page prefill with noncontiguous physical
pages, poisoned unused tail slots, and causal prefix masking. It does not
require the quantized embedding, model dispatch, continuous batching, or the
Day 5 kernel. Kernel names and implementation structure are not part of the
test contract; only the public numerical, metadata, and dtype behavior is.

For the reference Qwen decode schedule, specialize BF16 `D = 128`: each lane owns
four contiguous dimensions of Q, K, V, and the output. After all context
positions are visited, transpose the 32 partial output vectors through one
compact 32×32 threadgroup tile. Each SIMD group then reduces four dimensions
with `simd_sum`. This organizes the reduction in 4.25 KiB of scratch instead
of storing one full partial vector per scalar output thread. Keep a generic
BF16 specialization for other head dimensions so the optimization cannot
silently reinterpret `D = 32` as `D = 128`.

Day 4 must work without a future tiled/cooperative/MMA kernel. A dedicated
prefill kernel is optional here: reusing the direct decode implementation for
long queries is valid when it preserves the public behavior. Day 5 may replace
only the internal supported BF16 long-query region while preserving the same
API, generic fallback, and page-table semantics.

### Your solution's boundary

The walkthrough keeps page translation and online softmax in a course-owned
Metal operation so you can inspect them. The public checkpoint does not grade
an internal helper, tile, symbol, or library choice: a behaviorally equivalent
implementation or external low-level library is valid. To preserve the
chapter's systems outcome, the completed operator still consumes page storage
and its block table directly rather than rebuilding dense K/V in Python. MLX
SDPA remains a useful correctness oracle and performance baseline.

Both prefill and decode read page storage through this interface. Do not add a
dense-only special case: Day 5 optimizes this same paged contract.

## Task 3: Dispatch from the Model

```
src/tiny_llm/qwen3_week3.py
```

Modify `Qwen3MultiHeadAttention.__call__`, `Qwen3ModelWeek3.__init__`, and
`Qwen3ModelWeek3.__call__` to select the paged path and enable the custom
embedding only at this cumulative checkpoint.

Update the model so it can route to paged attention when the cache provides paged runtime metadata.

Append K/V to the page pool and pass its metadata to attention for every query
shape. The reference uses scalar prefill and vector decode schedules, but one
correct direct schedule may serve both. Neither choice changes cache dtype or
gathers a dense K/V tensor.

This creates the Day 4 routing policy:

```plain
every query shape -> correct direct page-walking attention
optional split -> scalar prefill and vector decode
```

Day 5 replaces the long-query schedule with paged FlashAttention without
changing this model-facing policy. `--disable-paged-attention` is a Day 4
dense-gather teaching ablation, not the completed serving path.

## Task 4: Connect It to Continuous Batching

```
src/tiny_llm/batch.py
```

Modify `Request.try_prefill`, `Request.decode_done`, `_step`, and
`batch_generate`. Request cleanup must call `TinyKvPagedCache.release` for
every layer cache.

Update request admission, slot reuse, and request removal so that:

- finished requests free their pages,
- in this teaching implementation, that means freeing pages from every layer cache,
- new requests allocate from the corresponding layer pool,
- active decode steps reuse page metadata instead of rebuilding dense K/V.

After this chapter, the serving stack has the right structure for a real high-throughput runtime: paging is no longer just a storage trick, but part of the execution model itself.

## Measure the Direct Page Walk

The goal of this lab is to decide when direct page traversal is useful. Paged
attention is not automatically a faster attention operator: it trades regular,
contiguous K/V access for flexible allocation and removes the dense repack that
would otherwise happen before attention. Your measurements must include both
sides of that trade.

Record three operator baselines on the same machine:

1. the dense Week 2 attention path in your solution, including any required
   K/V gather,
2. your direct paged-attention path,
3. the MLX attention path as a production-library baseline.

Use the same Qwen3-4B decode shape for all three paths. The dense control must
include its required page-to-dense gather; the direct path reads the same page
metadata; the MLX row measures its fused attention operator on the already
gathered tensor:

```bash
pdm run bench-week3-attention --solution tiny_llm --offline --contexts 128 1024 \
  --page-size 128 --warmup 5 --iterations 60 --repeats 4 \
  --cooldown-seconds 1 \
  --json-output benchmark_results/task367-final-main/raw/learner-week3-attention.json
```

This command measures your `tiny_llm` operators. The checked reference values
below are medians of four balanced fresh-process medians, with 60
synchronized calls after five warmups per process:

To reproduce those checked rows separately, rerun the command with
`--solution ref` and
`--json-output benchmark_results/task367-final-main/raw/week3-attention-final-main.json`.

| Context | Dense + gather | Direct paged | MLX fused |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 128 | 201.26 us | 228.58 us | 188.79 us |
| 1,024 | 468.39 us | 299.14 us | 250.04 us |

Direct traversal is 13.6% slower than dense-plus-gather at 128 tokens, but
36.1% faster at 1,024 tokens. MLX remains faster at both shapes. The checked
BF16 outputs match the readable dense equation within 0.00439453125 at
`S=128` and 0.001953125 at `S=1,024`. This operator benchmark contains no model
projection, so it isolates the attention paths directly.

### Checkpoint 1: Establish a Correct Direct Path

Implement the simplest page-walking kernel first. Verify that it:

- reads K/V through `block_table` without constructing a dense K/V tensor,
- ignores unused slots in the final page,
- matches dense attention for several page boundaries and context lengths,
- supports grouped-query attention when `H_q != H_kv`.

The correctness schedule may be slower than dense attention. At this
checkpoint, the useful result is a trustworthy baseline and a working runtime
interface.

### Checkpoint 2: Design the Decode Schedule

Optimize for the one-token decode shape instead of treating page traversal as a
serial loop. Work through these changes one at a time and benchmark after each
one:

1. assign the lanes of a SIMD group to adjacent elements of a head so K/V loads
   can be coalesced,
2. load a page-table entry once and reuse it for all positions in that page,
3. keep the query and online-softmax state in registers across page tiles,
4. combine partial dot products with SIMD reductions instead of threadgroup
   scratch memory and repeated barriers,
5. specialize the `L = 1` decode case so it does not carry prefill control flow,
6. prepare the batch's page metadata once per scheduler step rather than once
   per layer or attention head.

Also benchmark the write path separately. A fast page-reading kernel cannot
recover time lost to a functional whole-cache update before every layer.

For each change, explain which cost it targets: memory traffic, synchronization,
address calculation, or dispatch overhead. Keep a change only when the measured
result supports the explanation.

Optimize the paged path in your solution for the Qwen head dimension of 128,
but keep one grouped-query schedule rather than duplicating the online-softmax
recurrence for individual GQA ratios. This keeps the relationship among page
traversal, head mapping, and reduction visible in one kernel.

### Checkpoint 3: Evaluate the Serving System

Operator latency alone does not capture the purpose of paging. Run an
end-to-end workload with requests entering and leaving the batch, then report:

- time per decode step and aggregate tokens per second,
- peak KV-cache memory and the number of live requests admitted,
- bytes or time spent gathering and repacking K/V,
- paged-attention latency relative to the dense Week 2 path in your solution
  and MLX.

Keep the dense path as a teaching ablation so you can measure when contiguous
attention is faster. The completed serving route stays paged: it eliminates
repacks, reuses pages across scheduler steps, and leaves more measured KV
headroom in the fixed-batch trace. Proving that it admits more concurrent
requests requires a memory-capped admission sweep. Day 5 optimizes its
long-prefill schedule rather than routing around the page-table contract.

Use the paired serving runner rather than a preallocated static request:

```bash
pdm run bench-serving-progression --solution tiny_llm --offline --repeats 4 \
  --model qwen3-4b --num-seqs 16 --batch-size 4 \
  --min-input-len 128 --max-input-len 1024 \
  --min-output-len 32 --max-output-len 128 --prefill-step 128 \
  --warmup 1 --cooldown-seconds 1 \
  --json-output benchmark_results/task367-final-main/raw/learner-week3-serving.json
```

This command compares your Week 2 dense batch reconstruction, Week 3 paged
storage with the
dense-gather compatibility path, and Week 3 direct paged attention. All three
course rows use the same MLX quantized-projection seam; they differ in KV
representation and attention path. The runner resets page capacity after
warmup and reports prefill, output, and decode throughput alongside peak KV
bytes, copy volume, page reuse, and tail fragmentation. The direct path's
four-process medians are 672.68 prefill tok/s, 46.36 output tok/s, 105.01 decode
tok/s, and 0.618 requests/s. Its synchronized decode calls take
28.97/36.78/63.04 ms at median/p95/max; the completion gaps, which include
intervening scheduler and prefill work, are 30.16/222.18/239.49 ms.

These are cumulative system results, not an isolated Day 4 kernel speedup. The
ledger at
`benchmark_results/task367-final-main/task367-final-main-benchmark-ledger.md`
records the fixed trace, balanced process order, and denominator boundary.
Reproduce that checked reference trace separately with `--solution ref` and
`--json-output benchmark_results/task367-final-main/raw/week3-serving-final-main.json`.

```bash
pdm run test --week 3 --day 4
```
